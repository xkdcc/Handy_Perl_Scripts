**Description:**<br>
Add subtitle_tool.pl. <br>
My original purpose is to convert English language movie's subtitle file to the format I like.<br>
Then I can check the plain lines on my smart phone while listening to the voice:smile:<br>
Please take a look at subtitle_tool.html for the details.<br>
