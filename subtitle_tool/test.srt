14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,970
早上好
Good morning.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,700
一小时前  我辞去了库克县州检察官职务
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
我心情沉重
I did this with a heavy heart

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,430
将与那些诽谤性指控抗争到底
And a deep commitment to fight these scurrilous charges.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,270
我要强调
I want to be clear.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,530
我从未滥用职权
I have never abused my office.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,400
我从未因钱色贿赂
I have never traded lighter sentences for financial

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,930
而给人减刑
Or sexual favors.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,500
但是  我愧对妻子艾丽西娅和两个孩子
At the same time, I need to atone for my personal failings

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,900
我要向他们赎罪
With my wife, Alicia, and our two children.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,870
那些交易所涉款项  是我个人财产
The money used in these transactions was mine...

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,310
全都是
And mine alone.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,000
我从未动用公款
No public funds were ever utilized.

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,320
但我承认
But I do admit to a failure of

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,600
我与那些女人确实存在不正当关系
judgment in my privity with these women.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,500
我和艾丽西娅
Alicia and I...

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,430
请求媒体尊重我们的隐私
Ask that the press please respect our privacy.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,230
给我们时间平复伤痛
Give us time to heal.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,570
有上帝的保佑和家人的宽恕
With the love of god, and the forgiveness of my family,

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,130
我相信能赢回他们的信任
I know I can rebuild their trust.

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,570
我要感谢芝加哥民众
I want to thank the people of Chicago.

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,930
很荣幸为你们服务
It has been an honor to serve you.

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,900
我希望有朝一日
And I pray that one day,

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,500
能再次为你们服务  谢谢
I may serve you again. Thank you.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,770
请问你和妓女还保持着关系吗
Sir! Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,400
你与多少女人有染
How many were there, sir?

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,300
你还会再担任公职吗
Will you ever try to hold public office again?

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,630
请回答
Sir! Answer the question!

42
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,200
已经安排了《论坛报》和第四频道的采访
We have interviews set up with the Tribune and Channel Four.

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,370
我绝对不再接受任何采访
Absolutely not. I'm not doing any more interviews.

44
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,530
全都给我取消
I want you to cancel all of them. That's it.

45
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,460
我会告诉第二频道
I'll tell Channel Two

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,150
我们现在无可奉告
We don't have a comment at the present time.

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,350
但就此事的真实性深表怀疑
But we emphatically question the authenticity of this thing.

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,230
你没事吧
You all right?

49
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,660
福瑞克夫人
Mrs. Florrick, how long have you known

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,630
你何时知道丈夫有外遇的
Your husband was having an affair?

51
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,130
你打算怎么保护你的孩子
How are you going to protect your children?

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,200
请问  不是9点半开会吗
Excuse me, isn't the staff meeting at 9:30?

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,930
不是这间会议室  在楼上呢
You're in the wrong conference room. It's up one floor.

55
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,670
天啊
God...

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,770
这是一项大型集团诉讼
This is a major class action.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,190
能帮我们奠定顶级律所的地位
A case that could propel us to the top rank of full service firms,

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,350
这对年终奖金的影响
And I don't think I need to remind you

59
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,110
不用我多说了吧
What that will do to your year-end bonuses.

60
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,710
不过  谢弗林公司解聘了上一家律所
Anyway, Sheffrin-Marks fired their last firm

61
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,170
是因为他们不够专心
Because they took their eye off the ball.

62
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,810
所以  除非另行通知
So, until further notice,

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,040
你们的私生活全都取消了
Your personal lives have been cancelled.

64
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,540
你们有些人
So, we'll need some of you

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,530
要去帮着处理小客户案件
To help out with the lower profile client work

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,090
让我们的顶级律师腾出手来
To free up our top litigators.

67
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,850
艾迪  公路再分配案你去准备证词
Ed, you take the witness prep on highway redistribution.

68
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,270
东  布赖顿的犯人交给你了
Don, you take the Brighton criminal.

69
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,280
艾丽西娅负责那个法律援助案
And Alicia will take the pro bono.

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,430
其余人等
Everyone else,

71
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,560
你们要给谢弗林公司展现我们最强大的能力
your task is to show sheffrin-marks our "A" game, okay?

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,030
干活儿吧
Let's do this.

73
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,100
威尔
Will.

74
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,060
艾丽西娅
Alicia.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,100
抱歉没跟大家介绍一下你
I'm sorry I didn't introduce you in there.

76
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,900
这项集团诉讼忙坏我们了
Everything's moving real fast with this class action.

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,100
我是要感谢你给我这个机会
Well, I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,130
简直救我一命
It's a real life saver.

79
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,460
哪里  很高兴你能来
No, glad you could come aboard.

80
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,630
希望你能办好这个法律援助案
Hope you're all right with this pro bono.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,060
感觉怎么样
How'd it sound?

82
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,830
-很有意思  -很好
- Interesting.  - Good.

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,930
别紧张  你对枪弹残留没把握吗
Don't be nervous. You worried about the gunshot residue?

84
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,100
那个...  天啊
The, um... Oh, god.

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,730
铃声不错嘛  谁设的
Nice ring tone. Who gets that?

86
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,600
是我婆婆  我女儿编写的
Oh, my mother-in-law. My daughter programmed it.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
你的呢
And what's yours?

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,530
别提啦
I don't want to know.

89
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,460
关于枪弹残留...
So, um, the gun residue...

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,600
戴安  你给艾丽西娅介绍下情况吧
Diane, you're briefing Alicia, right?

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,660
很好  她来我就放心了
Good. You're in good hands.

92
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,230
抓紧做  然后吃晚饭
So, let's catch up, have dinner.

93
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,830
威尔对你评价很高
So, Will speaks highly of you.

94
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,830
他说你从乔治城大学毕业时  是班里第一名
He says you graduated top of your class at Georgetown.

95
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,000
啥时候毕业的
When was this?

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
-15年前  -哦
-15 years ago. - Uh-huh.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,630
然后你在哪儿干了2年来着
And you spent two years at...

98
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,960
高诗雅  埃布拉姆斯 & 阿博特律所
Crozier, Abrams & Abbott.

99
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,610
这律所不错
Good firm.

100
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,720
威尔说  你在那儿完成的计费工时是最多的
Will says you clocked the highest billable hours there.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
后来为啥不干了
Why did you leave?

102
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,930
因为孩子  还有彼得的工作
Well, the kids and Peter's career.

103
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,340
布莱恩  把卷宗给福瑞克女士
Brian! Can you get Mrs. Florrick the files?

104
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,230
好的
Mm-hmm. Sure.

105
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,430
你就把我当作导师吧  艾丽西娅
I want you to think of me as a mentor, Alicia.

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,630
这和镇上的校友关系
It's the closest thing we have

107
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,260
是最相似的
To an old boys' network in this town.

108
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,530
女人帮助女人  可以吗
Women helping women, okay?

109
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,830
好的
Okay.

110
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,260
我出道时  听过一条很棒的建议
When I was starting out, I got one great piece of advice.

111
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
男人可以懒惰  女人不行
Men can be lazy. Women can't.

112
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,300
这句话对你加倍适用
And I think that goes double for you.

113
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,330
不仅是因为
Not only are you

114
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,930
你重返工作岗位太晚
Coming back to the workplace fairly late,

115
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,300
而且你还有很不好的名声
But you have some very prominent baggage.

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,900
但既然她能扛住  你也能
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,000
多谢  布莱恩
Thanks, Brian.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
和很多律所一样  我们工时的5%
Like many law firms, we donate five percent

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,760
献给法律援助案
Of billable hours to pro bono.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,730
很遗憾  这案子早就超过我的工时量了
Sadly, I'm long past my quote on this one.

121
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,390
詹妮弗·刘易斯  26岁
Jennifer Lewis. 26 years old.

122
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,660
教二年级
Taught second grade.

123
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,700
被控谋杀其前夫
Accused of killing her ex-husband.

124
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,200
起诉方以为能让她稳坐45年牢
Prosecution thought it was a slam dunk 45 years,

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,630
但是陪审团上周却陷入僵局
But the jury came back last week deadlocked.

126
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,930
六个陪审员投票她有罪  六个投没有
Six jurors voted to convict, six not.

127
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,730
我甚至不明白为什么州检察官
I'm not even sure why the state attorney

128
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,860
要再次审判  除非他想要...维持正义
Is re-trying except he wants... justice!

129
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,360
他想证明自己  所以你要延用
He wants to prove himself. So, stick with my strategy

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,630
我第一次审讯时的策略  警察在调查中
From the first trial. The police focused

131
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,300
过早地锁定了詹妮弗
On Jennifer so early in the investigation,

132
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,000
而根本没找过那个劫车人
They never even looked for the carjacker.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,260
所以  让陪审团再次陷入僵局
Deadlock a jury a second time,

134
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,700
他们不可能再陷入僵局了  明白吗
They'll never re-try a third. Okay?

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,630
好  我们的调查员会帮你赶上
Okay, our investigator can get you up to speed

136
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,090
3点的保释听证会
For the bail hearing at 3:00.

137
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,930
科马克  我准备好了
Cormac, I'm ready.

138
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,530
听证会是今天吗
The hearing's today?

139
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,760
也可以推迟  但是那样
Well, we could delay, but that would leave

140
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,490
詹妮弗就得再监禁一个月
Jennifer incarcerated for another month.

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
别担心  没事的
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

142
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,060
美国教育机构不会反对保释的
The ASA's not going to argue against a recognizance release.

143
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,130
走  10点半开会
Let's go. Meeting's at 10:30.

144
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,560
但我承认私下里同这些女人打交道时
But I do admit to a failure of judgment

145
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,660
没有把持住
In my private dealings with these women...

146
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,600
对不起
Sorry.

147
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,300
...是我个人财产  全都是
...Mine and mine alone.

148
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,490
从没未动用公款
No public funds were ever utilized.

149
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,660
最新消息...
The recent news...

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,100
我来帮你
Oh, hey. Let me help you with that.

151
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,160
不用  我可以
No, I'm fine.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
没事  反正我也要去那边
No, no, I'm heading that way anyway.

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,860
我是凯里  另一个新来的副手
I'm Cary, the other new associate.

154
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,200
我记得你  我是艾丽西娅
Oh, right. Alicia.

155
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,160
我知道我们俩会是竞争对手
Yeah, look, I know we should be at each other's throats,

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,230
但是我只是想说
But I just want to say I really

157
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,300
我真的很敬佩你的能力
Respect what you doing here,

158
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,100
既能照顾家里  又能投身到工作中
Raising a family and then jumping right back into this.

159
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,200
我妈妈  她也想像你这样
My mom, she's thinking of doing the same thing.

160
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,330
-很好  -是啊
- Great. - Yeah.

161
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,490
你跟了法律援助案吧
So, you're on the pro bono, right?

162
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,730
太棒了
Yeah, that's great.

163
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,330
去年暑假我还参加了无罪计划的实习
I interned last summer at the innocence project.

164
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,650
我爸最好的朋友是巴瑞·谢克
My dad's best friend is Barry Scheck

165
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,060
感觉太棒了
And it was just amazing.

166
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,760
帮助别人  所以他们让我来谢弗林公司上班
Helping people. Here, they got me on the sheffrin-marks.

167
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,280
这肯定很有挑战性
I'm sure it will be challenging,

168
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,490
但是一天过去了  你都做了些什么
But at the end of the day, what have you really done?

169
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,460
为公司节省了几百亿吗
Saved a corporation a few billion dollars?

170
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,700
你想交换吗
You want to trade?

171
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,960
我也想啊  但是貌似他们另有安排
I would, but I guess they have other plans, so...

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,230
凯里  我差不多了  拿铁在你桌上
I am almost done, Cary. The latte's on your desk.

173
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,100
-谢谢  -你好  福瑞克夫人
-Thank you.- Hi, Mrs. Florrick.

174
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,930
貌似我们共用一个助手
Looks like we share an assistant,

175
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,030
如果我霸占她了就跟我说  好吗
So tell me when I'm hogging her, okay?

176
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,430
胜利属于强者
And let the best man win.

177
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,730
你说什么
Excuse me?

178
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,160

没什么
It's nothing.

182
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,230
不好意思
Oops.

183
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,130
没紧张  是你办公室
Don't worry, it's yours.

184
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,930
我是凯琳达·夏尔马  自己人

185
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,100

你是彼得·福瑞克的夫人

187

188
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,130
我在州检察官办公室干了3年

189
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,300
却被他开除了
He fired me.

190
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
好吧
Okay

191
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,060
你都知道些什么
So, what do you know?

192
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,700
客户是个二年级老师
The client is a second- grade school teacher.

193
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,860
-詹妮弗...  -刘易斯

194
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,030
因谋杀她前夫被捕

掩饰成劫车案的谋杀
Disguised as a carjacking.

200
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,560
他们认为  詹妮弗枪杀了她前夫
According to them, Jennifer shot her ex-husband

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,490

但是别惊慌  好吗
But I don't want you to freak out, okay?

210
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,060

他们还在电脑室放录像

215
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,160
那女生还说

253
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,000
女士

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,430
库克县刑事法庭
The criminal court

255

现在开庭

256
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,490
由尊敬的法官理查德·奎斯特主持庭审

259
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,680
尊敬的法官大人  我刚刚
Your honor, I just...

260
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,130
尊敬的法官大人  请您回顾一下
Your honor, just to refresh your memory,

261
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,390
被告被视为畏罪潜逃
The accused was deemed a flight risk

262
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,030
因为她在先前的监护权听证会上
Due to an earlier custody hearing

263
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
企图携其女儿潜逃
In which she threatened to run off with her daughter.

264
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,240
可是上周陪审团就这起谋杀案投票
And yet just last week a jury deadlocked

265
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,620
结果是六票对六票的僵局  布罗迪先生
On these murder charges six to six, Mr.Brody.

266
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,920
我知道我们的新州检察官
Now I know our new state's attorney

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,520
想看上去强硬些  但是为何要重审此案呢
Wants to look tough, but why are you fighting this?

268
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,980
法官大人  我只想...
Your honor, I just wanted to...

269
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,350
大家都准备好
The people are prepared to

270
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,650
开始重审了  法官大人
Retry this case right now, your honor.

271
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,680
如果福瑞克女士
If Mrs. Florrick

272
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,350
坚持要替委托人洗脱罪名
Is so intent on getting her client out,

273
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,450
为何她不赞成快速审判呢
Why doesn't she agree to a speedy trial?

274
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,920
-福瑞克女士  -是的  法官大人
- Mrs.Florrick? - Yes, your honor.

275
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,480
受人尊敬的彼得·福瑞克的妻子
The wife of the esteemed Peter Florrick?

276
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,460
你丈夫和我向来
Your husband and I never quite

277
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,670
意见相悖  女士
Saw eye to eye, ma'am

278
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,320
法官大人
Your honor

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,620
福瑞克女士  听我说
Mrs. Florrick, don't talk.

280
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,680
倘若原告认为这在某些方面
But if the prosecution thinks that this will in some way

281
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,820
会使我对你的委托人存有偏见的话
Prejudice me against your client,

282
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,550
他就大错特错了
He is sorely mistaken.

283
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,050
省点力吧  马坦
Nice try, Matan.

284
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,350
所以刘易斯女士理所应当
So Ms.Lewis is granted

285
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,620
审前释放
Pretrial release

286
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,350
通过电子追踪器
With electronic monitoring.

287
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,550
她的行动会被受限于临时住所
She is restricted to temporary housing,

288
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,750
以及代理人办公室之间
Attorney's offices, and transit in between.

289
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,420
鉴于这是重审
And given that this is a rerun,

290
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,460
我把再审日期定在25号
I'll set the trial date for the 25th.

291
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,180
现在  都满意了吧  很好
Now, are we all happy? Good.

292
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,980
谢谢你
Thank you.

293
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,620
没什么
Sure.

294
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,580
我们曾处得很好
We had a nice time

295
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,980
迈克尔说他想女儿
Michael talked about missing his daughter,

296
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,920
想我们在一起的时光
The life we had together.

297
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,950
我们正开车回家
We were driving home

298
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,650
接着
And, uh...

299
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,220
爆胎了
...we got a flat.

300
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,450
他出去修理
He was getting out to fix it,

301
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,050
然后我看到
And i saw...

302
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,550
一辆红色敞篷卡车
A red pickup truck.

303
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,050
有个人走近了迈克尔
A man came up to Michael.

304
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,120
本来我没看见枪
I didn't see the gun

305
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,180
直到
Until...

306
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,850
迈克尔
Michael!

307
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,150
迈克尔
Michael!

308
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,920
我看到迈克尔的脸
And I saw Michael's face.

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,520
已经...
It was, um...

310
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,820
要不要休息一下
Do you need to take a break?

311
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,780
不用了
Uh, no.

312
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,470
可以的话给我瓶水
Just-- if there was some water.

313
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,450
当然
Sure.

314
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,920
索尼娅  拿瓶水
Sonia, we need some water in here.

315
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
5分钟后送来
It's going to be about five minutes,

316
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,650
我还得上楼帮他做份同行比对
But then I've got to do his depo upstairs.

317
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,670
好吧  你做好了告诉我
Okay, uh, tell me when you're done.

318
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,000
你说这人从这里跑到红色卡车那儿
You say this man ran to a red pickup truck here,

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,770
接着从这方向穿过停车场离开
And took off in this direction across the parking lot.

320
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,030
这里有监视器
There's a surveillance camera here.

321
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,000
原告播放了录像  证明你在说谎
And the prosecution played it to make you look like a liar.

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
我没说谎
I'm not lying.

323
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,570
但是带子上根本没有卡车
But there's no truck on the tape.

324
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,420
这就是为何你正面临
And that's why you're facing a

325
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,470
重审而不是无罪释放
Retrial now and not an acquittal

326
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,070
我认为凯琳达想说的是  詹妮弗
I think what Kalinda is trying to say, Jennifer...

327
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,630
是否有可能是你自己搞错了
...is, is it possible that you were mistaken

328
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,230
那车开了这条路  而不是那条
And that the car went this way-- not that way?

329
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,870
你女儿吗
Is that your daughter?

330
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,030
他们不准我看她
They won't let me see her.

331
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,500
监护权在迈克尔父母手里
Michael's parents have custody.

332
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,470
我该怎么办
What am I going to do?

333
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,100
总有一天你会拿回监护权的
You're going to take it one day at a time.

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,630
我们给你安排了住所
We got you housing.

335
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,870
你先去那里
You're going to go there,

336
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,700
洗个澡  好好睡一觉
Take a shower, take a nap.

337
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,400
不要看电视
Don't turn on the tv.

338
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,430
喜欢看书吗
You like reading?

339
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,000
我会拿点书给你
I'm going to get you some books.

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,530
小说最合适
Fiction is best.

341
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,470
你可能不想  但还是要好好打扮下
You won't feel like it, but put on nice clothes and makeup.

342
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,170
勉强一下
Force yourself to.

343
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,570
不是为了上庭
Not for court--

344
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,470
为了自己
For you.

345
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,430
现在表面工作才最关键
It's the superficial things that matter most right now.

346
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,430
这能让案子有点起色吗
Does it ever get easier?

347
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,230
不会
No.

348
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,200
但你会感觉好点
But you do get better at it.

349
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,470
怎么了
What?

350
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,900
如果你老是这么感情用事  迟早会受不了
If you identify with too many clients, you burn out.

351
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,270
等我有什么事做对了你再提醒我  好吗
Why don't you tell me when I do something right, okay?

352
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,730
没问题
Sure.

353
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,470
陪审员那边就交给你了
You go and interview the jurors

354
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,930
而我则去查查监视镜头是怎么回事儿
And I'll try to figure out how a surveillance camera can lie.

355
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,050
没错  我曾是陪审团主席
That's right. I was the jury foreman.

356
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,730
希望你不介意回答我们几个问题  医生
And you don't mind answering a few questions for us, doctor?

357
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,560
以助于我们在重审中更好地扭转乾坤
It'll help us refine the case for the retrial.

358
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
没问题
No problem.

359
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,590
我不认为可以扭转乾坤
I don't think you'll need much refining.

360
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,690
此案事实清楚  证据确凿
Your case was very strong, very logical.

361
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,260
老实说  我觉得根本没必要对当事人进行重审
In fact, I'm not even sure why the other side went to trial.

362
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,060
我从头到尾都投得是赞成票
I voted for conviction right from the start.

363
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,520
好极了
Good.

364
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,960
你  你是指  无罪吗
You-you mean, acquittal.

365
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
不  是有罪
No, conviction.

366
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,320
但我是辩方律师
But I'm with the defense.

367
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,560
根本就没什么小卡车  她在说谎
She was lying about the pickup truck.

368
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,160
她手上还有枪弹残留
She had the gunshot residue on her hands.

369
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,790
能透露下由始至终都投有罪有多少人吗
Can I ask you how many voted for conviction from the start, sir?

370
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,460
-11票  -什么
- Eleven.- what?

371
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,160
但有一个始终坚持认为无罪
There was only one holdout.

372
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,490
就是九号陪审员
Juror number nine.

373
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,690
我们还跟她争论了三天
We argued with her for three days.

374
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,860
但法官说投票结果是
But the judge polled the jury

375
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,760
是六对六陷入了僵局啊
And they deadlocked six to six.

376
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,220
没错  法官只能宣布我们僵持不下
Yes, well, the judge would only declare us deadlocked

377
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,490
因为我们故意均衡了投票
If we were evenly split.

378
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,560
我们中的几个陪审员改变投票
So some of us agreed to change our vote

379
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,020
只是为了可以早日离开那儿
To not guilty just to get out of there.

380
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,490
如果不是九号陪审员
If it hadn't been for juror number nine

381
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,920
我们早就达成一致  判其有罪了
We would have convicted.

382
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,860
她说服不了我们又不肯妥协  大家都受不了了
She didn't convince us. she exhausted us.

383
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,090
不要帮我准备茶了  道瑞斯基夫人
No tea for me, Mrs. Duretsky.

384
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,260
不用客气
Suit yourself.

385
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,390
听其他陪审员说
So the other jurors

386
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,020
您就是那位一直固执己见的人  对吗
Said you were a holdout. Is that correct?

387
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,020
他们全都觉得自己精明完了
They all thought they were so much smarter than me.

388
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,420
同意我观点的票数却刚好跟他们一样
My vote counted just as much as theirs.

389
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,290
究竟是什么让你这么确信被告无罪呢
What exactly in the defense's case convinced you?

390
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,690
其实  老实说
Well, the whole thing, really.

391
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,520
我看人一向很准  只需一眼就能辩其好坏
I tend to look at a person and size them up pretty quickly.

392
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,390
那姑娘  我一眼就喜欢上她了
That lady, I liked her.

393
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,380
是说被告  詹妮弗吗
The defendant, Jennifer?

394
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,420
不  是辩方律师
No, that lawyer lady.

395
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,860
她从不对人摆架子
She never put on airs.

396
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,940
我就喜欢这样的人
I like that.

397
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,780
我只是想弄明白
Just so I'm clear.

398
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,000
辩护方提出詹妮弗手上的枪弹残留
The defense expert argued that the gunshot residue

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,430
是因为和第三人抗争所留
On Jennifer's hands came from the struggle.

400
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,430
-噢  我的小乖乖  -是你一直坚守无罪的原因吗
- Oh, so sweet. - Is that why you held out?

401
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,730
我根本就不知道你说得是啥
Oh, I don't know about that.

402
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,500
我不过是感情用事罢了
I just tend to get a feeling.

403
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,330
对吗  赛勒斯
Don't I, Cyrus?

404
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,950
杰姬
Hi, Jackie.

405
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,020
-怎么啦  -没什么
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.

406
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,180
我刚刚看了下要洗的衣服
I was going through the laundry

407
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,020
发现有格雷斯的有些校服
And I think some of Grace's school clothes

408
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,220
不太合适
You would find inappropriate.

409
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,650
我们刚刚搬了家
We just moved away.

410
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,830
格雷斯离开了所有好友
Grace has left all her friends.

411
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,020
我希望你能多陪陪她
I need you to go easier on her.

412
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,580
我要说的是
All I said was

413
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,280
我可以带她去逛逛  帮她选条长裤
I could take her shopping and help her find pants

414
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,420
选条能衬得她更苗条又漂亮的
That would make her look slimmer.

415
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,180
她体重完全符合健康标准
She's at a perfectly healthy weight.

416
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,220
我可不希望她整天尽想着减肥美体
I don't want her to have body image issues.

417
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,750
她迟早都会想的
She'll only have body image issues

418
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,980
如果她的体重再一路飙升的话
If she keeps gaining weight.

419
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,420
艾丽西娅
Alicia.

420
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,980
等我回家了我们再继续这个话题  好吗
Um, we'll talk about this when I get home later, okay?

421
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,580
-好的  -再见
- All right. - Bye.

422
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,150
你知道新员工凯里这个人吗
You know the new associate Cary?

423
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,580
那个穿布里奥尼的家伙吗
The one in the brioni?

424
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,820
干嘛  我可是个非常善于观察的人呢
What? I'm observant.

425
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,920
没错  正是那个穿布里奥尼的家伙
Yes, the one in the brioni.

426
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,050
他对我说"胜利属于强者"
He said to me, "may the best man win."

427
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,680
那究竟是什么意思
What exactly does he mean by that?

428
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,950
我想他应该是指
What he means is something

429
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,050
我们没对你坦白
I thought we weren't making public.

430
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,920
坦白什么
What?

431
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,420
听着  我们只有一个副职的空缺
Look, we only have one associate position open.

432
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,520
所以我们打算同时聘用两个应聘者
So we agreed to hire two applicants,

433
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,570
然后在六个月之内决定谁去谁留
And in six months decide which one to retain.

434
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,070
如此说来  我得和凯里一争高下了
So this is a contest between me and Cary?

435
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,720
说得再难听点儿  这是场生死大战
It was either that or a cage match.

436
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,720
我只是希望你的法律援助案顺利
I'm just happy your pro bono's going well.

437
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,720
探视时间快结束了
Visiting hours are almost over.

438
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,530
听他们说有位探访者
They said a visitor.

439
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,110
我还以为是妈妈
I thought mom.

440
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,240
我一直很忙
I've been busy.

441
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,510
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

442
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,470
我需要你签几样东西
I need you to sign some things.

443
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,850
没问题
Okay.

444
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,650
房子里的东西我没能都拿走
We didn't get everything we wanted on the house.

445
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,070
市场不景气  不好卖
It's a bad market to sell.

446
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,900
我明白
I see that.

447
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,130
大部分费用都花在了你的诉讼费上
We used most of it for your court costs.

448
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,340
而我的薪水得用来支付房租
The rent will come out of my salary

449
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,130
孩子们也不得不去公立学校就读
And the kids are going to have to stay in public school.

450
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,030
他们怎么样了
How are they?

451
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,300
妈妈说她现在帮着打理家务
Mother says that she's helping out around the house.

452
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,940
他们都很好
They're good.

453
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,620
格雷斯总会因为衣服和你妈妈争论不休
Grace argues over clothes with your mother,

454
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,460
扎克也会利用你在学校交到朋友了
And Zach is using you to make friends at school.

455
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,210
我都不知道这该说是好事
Which I don't know if that's a healthy thing

456
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,280
还是坏事
Or something worse.

457
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,020
利用我
Using me?

458
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,890
Funnyordie网站上有关于你的片段
Funnyordie has a skit about you.

459
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,320
我想  对他而言这是件很酷的事儿
It's cool, I guess.

460
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,820
瞧瞧吧
Here.

461
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,390
艾丽西娅  我知道这让你倍受煎熬
Alicia, I know this has been hard on you,

462
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,990
但你得相信我
But you have to believe me.

463
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,690
我是清白的
I'm innocent...

464
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,490
关于挪用公款这事
Of the abuse of office charges.

465
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,330
你以为我会相信你的鬼话吗  彼得
You think I give a damn about that, Peter?

466
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,330
他们在格雷斯电脑室里放了一段
They were playing a tape in Grace's computer lab

467
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,430
你吮吸一个妓女脚趾头的录像
Of you sucking the toes of a hooker.

468
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,290
你以为我会在乎你们雇佣合同里
You think I care about the small print

469
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,390
那些附属细则吗
In your employment contract?

470
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,430
听我说  我是被陷害的  州检察官
Come on, I was set up. the state attorneys...

471
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,130
得了吧  彼得  我不想再费唇舌了
Oh, come on, Peter. I don't want to talk...!

472
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,190
我不会和你吵架
I'm not going to fight.

473
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,430
我来这里不是和你吵架的

474

妈妈说你接手了一个案子

475
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,490
恭喜
Congratulations.

476
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,960
是那个伪装劫车案吗
The fake carjacking, right?

477
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,630
法官是谁
Who's the judge?

478
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,430
理查德·奎斯特
Richard Cuesta.

479
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,830
你不是在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

480
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,260
他和我有仇
He hates me.

481
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,660
我知道
I know.

探访时间到了

483
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,030
探访时间到了

些许蹊跷  不是吗
about that case, don't you?

有流言称
There was a rumor going around

488
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,930
有些证据被掩盖了  埋没了
That something got buried, pitted.

489
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,330
什么东西
What?

490
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,330
证物
Evidence

491
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,030

Or testimony.

492
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,830
我该走了
I should go.

493
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,330
听着
Hey, listen,

494
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,290
谢谢你这么久操劳家计
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.

495
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,560
我不会让你永远这么辛劳的
It's not going to last forever.

496
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,390
我的律师认为受理上诉的法院

497
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,890
愿意听证我的案子
Is going to hear my case.

498
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,660
如果他们改判  所有事情都会回到原样
If they overturn it, everything goes back to normal.

499
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,190
是时候走了
It's time.

500
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,560
彼得
Peter,

501
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,660
永远不可能回到原样了
It's never going back to normal.

502
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,230
警方一发现詹妮弗手中枪弹残留
As soon as the cops found gunshot residue

503
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,310
就断定她是嫌疑人
On Jennifer's hands, they had their suspect.

504
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,070
那如果他们忽视了其他的细节呢
So what if they pitted everything else?

505
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,810
如果他们并没有忽视呢
And what if they didn't?

506
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,240
在这儿争论毫无意义
Arguments are cheap.

507
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,670
那是什么
What's that?

508
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,070
犯罪实验室分析结果综述第一页
Page one of the crime lab summary.

509
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,870
我仔细看了才发现证据  看左上角
I was digging through discovery. Look at the top corner.

510
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,340
看起来像个订书钉
Looks like a staple.

511
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,770
确实是订书钉
It is a staple.

512
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,840
这很奇怪因为
And that's odd because...?

513
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,940
没有第二页
There's no page two.

514
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,640
如果没有第二页
Why do they need a staple

515
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,370
他们为什么要用订书钉
If there's no page two?

516
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,410
你认为警方隐瞒了一些指向另外一个
You think the cops kept something out of the discovery

517
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,270
嫌疑人的证据
That pointed to another suspect?

518
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,840
我认为他们做了  要不就在法庭上
Well, I think either they did or it would be helpful

519
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,540
暗示他们做了
In court to imply that they did.

520
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,910
离开庭还有两天
Two days away from trial

521
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,210
你却想放弃原先的策略
And you're thinking of dropping the old strategy?

522
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,970
戴安仅仅说服了养猫老妇被告无罪

523
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,840
一辆卡车被人看到疾驰

524
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,150
穿过灯光明亮  空荡荡的停车场
Through a well-lit, empty parking lot.

525
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,410
一辆卡车怎么可能从监控摄像头下溜走呢
How is a truck missed by that surveillance camera?

526
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,910
标记错误时间的监控录像
Mismarked surveillance tape.

527
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,350
有了
Yeah.

528
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,880
你在做什么
What are you doing?

529
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,510
工作
Working.

530
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,250
这可比传票强多了
These are better than subpoenas.

531
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,310
我们只需要弄清监控系统的运作方式
We just need to see how the surveillance system works,

532
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,410
我们五分钟就可以搞定走人了
And we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.

533
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,780
-五分钟  -是的
- Five minutes? - Uh-huh.

534
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,380
好的  这里往下走就到了
Okay, it's down here.

535
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,180
我丈夫为什么要炒你鱿鱼
Why did my husband fire you?

536
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,050
他指责我干了两份活
He accused me of working two jobs.

537
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,280
你有吗
Were you?

538
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,080
是的
Oh, yeah.

539
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,780
瞧  计算机自动录下了监控记录
See, the computer automatically records the surveillance.

540
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,310
并标注了日期时间
Marks it with date and time.

541
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,910
-那是谋杀当晚的录像吗  -是的
- Is that the night of the murder? - Yeah.

542
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,750
就算是计算机错误地标注了日期时间
I mean, even if the computer did mismark it,

543
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,550
我在停车场巡视了一小时
I make an hourly tour of the lot,

544
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,810
没有看到小卡车
And I didn't see no pickup truck.

545
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,280
瞧  那个人就是我
Look, that's me.

546
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,950
十一点零三分  就在谋杀案发生前
11:03, just before the murder.

547
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,780
我们可以拿一份拷贝吗
Can we get copies of these?

548
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
当然可以
Sure.

549
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,910
蕾妮
Lanie?

550
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,050
蕾妮
Lanie?!

551
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,150
什么事
What?

552
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,310
给我拿几个磁盘
Get me some disks.

553
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,310
好的
All right.

554
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,210
你的机器多吐出一罐可乐
Your machine spit out an extra one.

555
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,550
你要喝吗
Would you like it?

556
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,710
多漂亮的孩子啊
Oh, what beautiful children.

557
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,850
一对儿女  一对儿孙女
Two kids, two grandkids.

558
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,580
蕾妮  那些磁盘怎么样了
Hey, Lanie, how about those disks?!

559
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,770
他总是这么可爱吗
Is he always so charming?

560
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,820
他只是个懒散的商场保安
Oh, he's just a lazy mall cop.

561
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,430
他要花半天时间看黄色录像
He spends half the day surfing porn,

562
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,660
而到了值夜班的时候
And with night shift,

563
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,380
他就赖在椅子上了
He can't get his skinny ass out of his chair.

564
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,480
总是要我早上去叫醒他
I'm always waking him up in the morning.

565
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
男人啊
Oh! Men.

566
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,180
我和彼得谈过  他说你去看他了
I talked to Peter. He said you dropped by.

567
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,540
我去了
I did.

568
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,840
我很高兴
I'm glad.

569
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,980
他在那里倍受煎熬
He's hurting in there.

570
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
他很勇敢
He's very brave.

571
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,830
但他在受煎熬
But he's hurting.

572
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,570
他需要你的原谅  艾丽西娅
He needs you to forgive him, Alicia.

573
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,200
杰姬
Jackie,

574
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,930
我给他当了15年的洗衣娘
I spent 15 years doing his laundry,

575
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,970
打扫他的房间
Cleaning his house,

576
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,000
从来没有任何质疑
Never asking a single question

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,230
因为我觉得没什么好质疑的
Because I didn't think I had to.

578
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,030
他带走了我们的全部共同财产
And he took everything I thought we had

579
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,100
然后送给了每一个人
And he just put it out there for everyone.

580
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,630
他也不想的
He didn't want that.

581
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,800
那种压力...
The press...

582
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,030
杰姬
Oh, Jackie,

583
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,830
别说了  彼得根本没替我们着想
Stop it, please! Peter wasn't thinking of us.

584
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,570
这需要时间  艾丽西娅
It takes time, Alicia.

585
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,870
给他点时间
Give it time.

586
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,300
我现在的时间都放在这些锅碗瓢盆上了
Any time I have right now is for them.

587
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,800
我想让她死
I want her dead.

588
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,400
我也是  只是时候未到
Me, too, just not quite yet.

589
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
那为什么扎克和我不能自己照顾自己
So why can't Zach and I just watch ourselves?

590
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
亲爱的  她每天只在这里呆几个小时
Honey, she's only here a couple of hours a day.

591
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,330
杀伤力极强的几小时
A couple very damaging hours.

592
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,430
你能应付的
You'll heal.

593
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,600
把她的来电铃声换了
And change her ring tone.

594
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,870
请报出您的姓名
Please state your name.

595
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,600
辛迪·刘易斯
Cindy Lewis.

596
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
你嫁给被害人多久了
And you were married to the victim

597
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,430
刘易斯太太
For how long, Mrs. Lewis?

598
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,770
快2年了
Two years until...

599
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,070
-谢谢  -你认为
- Thank you. - And how would you describe

600
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,610
你丈夫和他前妻的关系如何
Your husband's relationship with his first wife?

601
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,070
通常情况下都不错  甚至很友好
Well, most of the time it was fine, friendly even,

602
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,370
但在最后一次听证会后
But after the last custody hearing,

603
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,330
迈克尔为詹妮弗而感到担忧
Michael was pretty worried about Jennifer...

604
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,330
反对 法官大人
Objection, your honor.

605
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,370
反对理由
On what grounds?

606
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,070
无事实依据
Hearsay.

607
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,530
理由不错  福瑞克律师  反对无效
Nice try, Mrs. Florrick. I'll allow it.

608
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,270
继续  刘易斯太太
Go ahead, Mrs. Lewis.

609
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,330
他担心詹妮弗意图要
Um, he was worried jennifer was intent

610
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,670
得到单方监护权
On getting sole custody.

611
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,030
谢谢  刘易斯太太
Thank you, Mrs. Lewis.

612
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,300
辩方律师
Your witness.

613
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,070
刘易斯太太  你说迈克尔担心詹尼弗
Now, Mrs. Lewis, you stated that Michael was worried

614
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,170
然而在接下来的一周
About Jennifer, yet in the week following...

615
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,200
反对 法官大人
Objection, your honor.

616
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,430
反对有效
Sustained.

617
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,830
刘易斯太太  你声称
In your testimony, Mrs. Lewis, you claimed

618
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,530
詹尼弗想得到单方监护权
That Jennifer wanted sole custody,

619
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,600
但是否...
But isn't it true...?

620
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,030
-反对  -反对有效
- Objection.  - Sustained.

621
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,300
继续试  福瑞克律师  你会问到重点的
Keep trying, Mrs. Florrick. you'll hit on it.

622
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,030
刘易斯太太
Mrs. Lewis,

623
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,000
是谁提出去吃晚饭的
Whose idea was it to have dinner,

624
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,170
詹妮弗还是迈克尔
Jennifer's or Michael's?

625
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,530
迈克尔
Michael's.

626
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,600
这难道不能表明
So wouldn't that suggest

627
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,630
他的态度已经有所转变了吗
That his attitude had changed towards...?

628
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,670
反对
Objection.

629
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,970
反对有效
Sustained.

630
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,570
谢谢
Thank you.

631
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,300
冷静点
Clam down

632
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,800
布里格斯警官  辩方提到案发当时
Now, detective Briggs, the defense has referred

633
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,230
在案发点附近有三起未破获的劫车案
To three unsolved carjackings in the neighborhood at that time.

634
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,830
-您知道此事吗  -知道
- Are you aware of this?  - I am.

635
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,930
那您怎么知道本案
So why didn't you consider this incident

636
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,330
不是又一起连环劫车案呢
To be another in that series of carjackings?

637
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,860
首先  被抢的都是豪华汽车
Firse of all are luxury cars

638
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,070
一辆雷克萨斯和两辆宝马
One LEXUS and two BMWs.

639
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,430
而本案被害人驾驶的是2001款的本田
The victim in this crime was driving a 2001 Honda,

640
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,700
并且燃油管上没发现剪切的痕迹
And there was no clip on the fuel line.

641
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,120
劫车者通常都会剪切燃油管
This is what the carjackers did

642
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,500
来使豪华车抛锚
To force the luxury cars over.

643
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,930
没错
That's right.

644
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,800
但本案受害人只是因为车胎漏气了
But in the case of the honda, the victim pulled over

645
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,100
才将本田停在了路边
Because he had a flat.

646
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,370
是的 女士 我们在车的前轮上
Yes, ma'am, there was a nail driven

647
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,400
发现一枚钉子
Into the front driver tire.

648
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,430
明白了  那为什么劫车者
I see. now, why is this something

649
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,670
就不会选用钉子呢  探长
A carjacker would never do, detective?

650
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,770
那只会适得其反
It would defeat the purpose.

651
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,400
车胎都漏气了  你还怎么偷车
I mean, how do you steal a car with a flat?

652
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,930
辩方律师
Your witness.

653
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,200
情况并不乐观  对吗
It's not going well, is it?

654
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,000
现在还言之尚早
It's early.

655
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,170
福瑞克律师
Mrs. Florrick?

656
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,270
布里格斯警官  "坑"是什么意思
Detective Briggs, what is "the pit"?

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,300
你说什么
Excuse me?

658
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,430
在警界  "坑"是指什么
In police circles, what is "the pit"?

659
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,470
反对  法官大人
Objection, your honor.

660
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,370
反对理由
On what grounds?

661
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,430
理由是...引导证人
On the grounds that... relevance.

662
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,230
那我们来看看能引导到什么程度好了
Well, let us see how relevant this becomes, Shall we?

663
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,530
警官
Detective?

664
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,630
"坑"是...
The pit...

665
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,600
是警局的暗语
The pit is police slang

666
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,670
是指被认为与犯罪现场无关的证据
For evidence thought irrelevant at a crime scene.

667
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,070
所以  如果说一名警官提到要将某样东西
So when an officer's referring to dropping something

668
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,970
丢到"坑"里  或是要让它变成"坑"
In "the pit," or "pitting it,"

669
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,630
他是指什么
he refers to what?

670
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,170
是指将这件东西从犯罪现场排除
Excluding it from the crime scene narrative.

671
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,570
但我们排除的都是不相关的资料
But that only applies to irrelevant details.

672
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,800
我们是不会排除与案件有关的证据的
We wouldn't exclude pertinent evidence.

673
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,300
在刘易斯案中有没有证据被排除
Was anything pitted from the Lewis crime...?

674
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,830
法官大人  反对
Your honor, objection!

675
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,400
证据一直都是登记在案的
Evidence is logged in all the time

676
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
这证明了新的发现与本案无关
That proves irrelevant to the discovery.

677
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
我这不是为了混淆视听
It's not an intent to deceive.

678
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,830
只是想尝试解读真相
It's an attempt to decipher facts.

679
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,200
我们并不知道这是否...
We don't even know if it is...

680
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,470
我还要指责辩方没有提供任何一条
And to blame the prosecution for not coming up with every

681
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,670
-有依据的信息  -她只是抓住案子
-Single possible detail?!  - She's trying to build

682
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,570
-的重点  -够了  福瑞克律师
- A case on a staple...  - okay, okay, Mrs. Florrick!

683
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,270
这些内容都没有在初审的时候提出
None of this was in the first trial.

684
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,470
你是想提出新的辩辞吗
Is it your intention to pursue a new defense?

685
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,000
是的  法官大人
Yes, your honor.

686
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,500
辩方律师是在试图引导陪审团
Counsel's trying to mislead the jury.

687
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,170
她是在暗示一桩警界腐败案
She's implying there was police corruption.

688
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,170
闭嘴  马坦
Oh, shut up, Matan!

689
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,840
她是否说对了  这才是问题所在
Is she right? That's the question.

690
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,370
你有没有隐瞒什么
Did you bury something?

691
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,170
我们都知道这是怎么回事
We all know what's going on here.

692
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,800
彼得·福瑞克是个腐败的
Peter Florrick was a corrupt

693
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,040
并且已经被定罪的州检察官
And convicted state's attorney.

694
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,800
即使有证据被隐瞒  也是他隐瞒的
If evidence was buried, he buried it.

695
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,870
现在她学到了她丈夫那手
And now she's benefiting from his knowledge.

696
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,900
你拿来的材料
Which still leaves you

697
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,740
也是少了几页的
With some pages missing here!

698
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,370
我要你周一之前
I'll give you till Monday

699
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,540
把他们补齐
To produce them

700
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,170
还要呈上他们提过的所有证据
Along with any evidence they reference.

701
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,270
那时我再进行裁决
Then I'll rule on admissibility.

702
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,840
至于你  福瑞克律师
And you, Mrs. florrick,

703
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,570
这些东西我不清楚是别人给你的
I'm not sure if you're being fed this stuff,

704
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,400
还是你自己找到的
Or you doing on your own,

705
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,940
但如果是前者
But if it's the former,

706
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,630
那你就是在铤而走险  挑战道德底线
You're walking a very narrow ethical line here.

707
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,240
你明白吗
You understand that?

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,740
明白  法官大人
Yes, your honor.

709
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,700
指令很简单
The directive was simple.

710
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,260
按照第一阶段审讯的套路就行了
Follow the strategy of the first trial.

711
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,490
不过  你得拼命去搜集那些
Instead, you're pushing for evidence

712
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,620
即使对你的案子毫无帮助的证据
That might not even help your case.

713
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,590
我和第一陪审团会谈过
I interviewed the first jury,

714
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,020
他们以11:1的投票予以定罪
And they voted 11 to one to convict.

715
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,820
对不起  不是这样的  当时双方票数相等
Excuse me. That's not true. It was evenly split.

716
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,420
不  有一半的陪审员改变了投票
No. Half the jurors switched their votes

717
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,020
虽然没有全数通过就不能开庭
When they couldn't get a troubled juror to deliberate.

718
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,420
所以我运用了自己的判断力来改变策略
So, I used my judgement to change strategies.

719
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,320
你的判断力就是不及时向我们反馈信息吗
And was it your judgement not to update us?

720
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,550
她只是初级助理
She's a junior associate

721
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,550
却自视过高
Who doesn't think she's a junior associate.

722
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,680
他丈夫曾是州检察官
Her husband was a state's attorney.

723
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,990
她过去住在高地公园
She lived in highland park.

724
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,680
这不只是在训练一只老狗
It's not just teaching an old dog new tricks.

725
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,220
而是在训练一只骄傲的老狗
It's teaching an entitled dog new tricks.

726
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,320
好了  戴安  关键是她在搜集那些
Come on, Diane. The problem is she's catching evidence

727
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,780
被你忽视的证据
That you overlooked.

728
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,990
我知道你教导过不少女律师
I've seen you mentor these women

729
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,290
直到她们开始与你竞争
Until they start competing with you.

730
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,920
-然后你....  - 什么  你在说什么
- And then you...  - What? Excuse me?

731
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
我提议惩戒一下艾丽西娅
I say we reprimand Alicia

732
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,450
任命凯里为首席律师
And put Cary in as first chair.

733
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,750
谢谢
Thank you.

734
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,680
肯定是她  对吗
That's her, isn't it?

735
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,520
索尼娅  你能不能....
Sonia, can you...?

736
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,450
艾丽西娅·福瑞克的办公室
Alicia florrick's office.

737
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,990
请稍等
One moment, please.

738
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,320
詹尼弗  接电话
Jennifer, pick up.

739
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,390
喂
Hello?

740
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,950
你好  宝贝儿
Hi, baby.

741
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,250
我好想你
I miss you so much.

742
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,390
艾丽西娅
Alicia.

743
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,020
是狗毛
It's dog hair.

744
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,320
被掩埋了的证据
The pitted evidence.

745
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
我和一个取证室的一个朋友谈过
I talked to a friend at the crime lab.

746
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,150
他让我查阅了证据记录
Gave me a preview of the evidence.

747
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,390
记录
A preview?

748
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,250
受害者的身上发现有狗毛
It's dog hair found on the victim's clothes.

749
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,720
警察排除了这点
Cops pitted it

750
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,420
因为他们在迈克尔的住处也发现了狗毛
Because they found dog hair at Michael's residence

751
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,990
他们猜测属于同一只狗
And thought it was the same.

752
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,120
结果不是吗
But it's not?

753
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,450
那是只意大利灵提
It's from an Italian greyhound.

754
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,520
迈克尔和詹尼弗都没养过这种狗
Neither Michael nor Jennifer had greyhounds.

755
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,220
还有  狗毛上有一种药剂成分
So also, a chemica on the hair...

756
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,890
爱克托林
Alco ectolin...

757
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,720
一种用于肌肉和关节疼痛的犬用药剂
A lotion for muscle and joint pain.

758
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,750
那是化学元素号码吗
That's the chemical number?

759
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,350
不  是他的手机号
No, his cell number.

760
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,050
我答应陪他喝一杯
I agreed to drinks.

761
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,190
所以我们现在要找的是
So we're looking

762
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,320
一只患有关节病的意大利灵提的饲养者
For an arthritic greyhound owner.

763
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,680
我们  我听说你被降为列座律师了
We? I hear you're being bumped to second chair.

764
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,490
什么时候
When?

765
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,990
明天下班
End of tomorrow.

766
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,390
凯里被提升了
Cary's being transitioned in.

767
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,420
他会采用第一阶段审讯的策略
And he'll go back to the first trial strategy.

768
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,020
他这一年坏运不断
It's not a good year for him.

769
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,490
现在  这位全明星后卫又要
The all-star point guard is currently suing

770
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,720
控告他的前女友伤害罪
His ex-girlfriend for damages,

771
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,590
希望法官最终能裁定
Hoping the judge can finally determine

772
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,220
这个案子是实情还是炒作
Whether this case was fact or fantasy.

773
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,050
你可能只知道她叫  "安贝儿"
You know her simply as "Amber,"

774
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,780
是个曾使州检察官--芝加哥坏小子
The young woman who brought down

775
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,390
彼得·福瑞克堕落的年轻女人
Bad boy Chicago state's attorney Peter Florrick.

776
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,950
尽管她表示想把这件丑闻抛到脑后
Though she says she wants to leave the scandal far behind,

777
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,590
但这位应召女郎安贝儿·麦迪逊
Celebrity call girl Amber Madison

778
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,550
其实已决定要写一本她和福瑞克的回忆录
Has decided to write a memoir about her time with florrick.

779
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,750
在内部的独家报道中...
In this exclusive interview with Inside Edition...

780
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,050
你真的还要工作啊
Do you really have to work?

781
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,510
对  还需要十多分钟
Yeah, ten more minutes.

782
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,850
扎克  我用下你的电脑
Zack, I need your computer.

783
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,920
妈妈  我刚升级了我的警告级别
Mom, I just raised my wanted level.

784
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,290
好的  宝贝儿  我替你高兴
Yeah, I'm happy for you, honey.

785
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,550
当彼得的父亲在伊利诺斯州法院工作时
When Peter's father was on the illinois court,

786
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,990
他从来不把案子带回家  一次也没有
He never brought a single case home, not once.

787
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,190
他是法官  杰姬  我只是初级助理  扎克
He was a judge, Jackie. I'm a junior associate. Zach?!

788
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,950
帮我把这两个盘放在一起进行对比播放
I need you to play These two computer disks side by side.

789
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,820
能把我的电脑和你的放一块吗
Can you set up my computer next to yours?

790
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,120
你妹妹怎么样了
Hey, how's your sister?

791
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,050
她还在和奶奶对抗吗
She still fighting with grandma?

792
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,680
这是什么
What is it?

793
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,020
这是凶案当晚的一个视频
It's video Of the night of the murder.

794
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,050
就是一些死者的遗容
Like faces of death?

795
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,020
妈妈  我看过更可怕的
Mom, I've seen worse.

796
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,350
你真可爱
You're adorable.

797
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,780

I'm not.

798
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,350
是的  你很可爱
Yes, you are.

799
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,190

800
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,050

是证据

This is at 11:03 the night of the murder, Mr. North,

803
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,290

805
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,190
是的

你没有看到小货车或劫车人跑过
And you saw no pickup truck, no carjacker racing past,

807
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,450
没看到任何被告宣称她看到的东西

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,820
谢谢
Thank you.

810
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,050

814
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,890
州检察官来了
State's attorney's here.

815
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,220

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,320
他们现在担心她会
They're worried she's getting

817

从她丈夫那学到些技巧
The stuff from her husband.

818
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,420
这是三个图像

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,630
中间是15号晚的监控录像
The middle is the image of the surveillance from the 15th,

820
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,150
也就是案发当晚
The night of the murder,

821
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,950
左边是14号晚的录像
And the one over there on the left is the image from the 14th,

822
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,120
也就是案发的前一晚
The night before the murder, and the one

823
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,950
右边是16号的  也就是案发后的第二晚
On the right is from the 16th, the night after the murder.

824
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,820
你能看到上面的日期吗
Can you see the dates on those?

825
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,050
是的  可以
Uh, yes, I can.

826
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,750
按照你之前说的  那个人是你
So, as you said before, there you are

827
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,750
当时是案发当晚的11点03分
The night of the murder, at 11:03,

828
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,020
你在停车场巡逻
Making your circuit of the lot.

829
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,220
这个则是你在案发前一晚
And... there you are the night before the murder

830
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,820
再看案发后第二晚  你也在做相同的事
And the night after, doing the same thing.

831
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,190
-这肯定很闷  -不会  女士
- It must get old. - Um, no, Madam.

832
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,190
我的工作没有你的报酬多  但我爱它
My job doesn't pay as much as yours, but i still love it.

833
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,850
很好
Okay, good.

834
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,520
现在  诺斯先生
Now, Mr. North,

835
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,190
我们快进一下  可以吗
Let's fast-forward, shall we?

836
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,620
案发当晚  45分钟后
45 minutes...the night of the murder.

837
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,720
那个
And there.

838
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,350
你看到什么了
What do you see?

839
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,850
-没什么  -没有吗
- Nothing. - No?

840
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,220
就在那里  也许你
It's right there...maybe you

841
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,780
需要靠近点
Need to move in a little closer.

842
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,220
是个购物袋  看上去像个购物袋
Oh, it's a shopping bag, it looks like a shopping bag.

843
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,250
事实上  那就是购物袋
Actually, it is.

844
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,750
是个塑料购物袋
It's a plastic shopping bag.

845
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,880
当晚风很大  那塑料袋被吹过停车场
It was a very windy night that night, and it blew across the lot

846
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,090
-在11点48分  -法官大人  反对
- At 11:48. - Your honor, objection.

847
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,420
-这与本案有什么关系  -我也不知道
- What does it have to do with anything. - Beats me.

848
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,450
但我很感兴趣  你呢  布罗迪先生
But I'm interested, aren't you, Mr. Brody?

849
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,680
反对无效
Overruled.

850
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,550
好的  那么我们将其他两个录像
Okay, so let's fast-forward the other two monitors

851
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,550
案发前和案发后的录像
The night before the murder and the night after the murder

852
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,720
快进到同一个时间点
To the same time code.

853
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,120
这是14号的
Here's the 14th...

854
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,350
这是16号的
And the 16th.

855
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,120
你看到什么了
What do you see?

856
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,450
我不知道
Um... I don't know.

857
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,020
我认为你知道  先生
I think you do know, sir.

858
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,950
要么是你让一个塑料袋
Either you have a plastic bag

859
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,750
每晚11点48分被吹过停车场
Blow across your lot every night at 11:48,

860
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,490
要么这些就是同一卷录像的复本
Or these are duplicates of the same tape.

861
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,750
不是的
No, it...

862
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,020
不是你们看到的那样
It's not wh-what it looks like.

863
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,250
我明白  先生
I understand, Sir.

864
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,420
你并不是有意要误导警察
You didn't willfully mislead the police.

865
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,920
是的  没错
Yeah, that's correct.

866
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,450
只是天越来越冷  所以有时候
No, it's just that it gets cold out there, and sometimes

867
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,920
-你没去停车场巡逻  -是的
- You don't make the circuit of the lot. - Yes.

868
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,320
所以当你不去巡逻时
So on the nights that you don't go out,

869
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,650
你就不录下当晚的监控图像
You don't record the actual surveillance image,

870
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,350
你将电脑设置好
You set your computer up

871
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,650
复制前一天晚上的图像
To duplicate the night before,

872
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,550
以防经理检查
Just in case your manager checks in,

873
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,720
是这样吗
Is that correct?

874
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,050
是的
Yes.

875
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,650
因此我确定
Just so I'm clear,

876
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,750
案发当晚没有录像
There is no recording the night of the murder,

877
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,320
而且你也没在那看到或没看到
And you were never there to see or not see

878
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,780
小货车或劫车者
The pickup truck or the carjacker.

879
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,990
对不起
I'm sorry.

880
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,050
是的
Uh, yes.

881
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,950
没有问题了
No further questions.

882
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,170
所以你在想
So, you're wondering whether demolishing

883
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,730
推翻控方主要证人
The key prosecution witness

884
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,140
是否能保住你首席的位置
Didn't just save your ass as first chair

885
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,370
干得好  顺便说一句
Nice work, by the way.

886
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,400
谢谢
Thanks.

887
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,830
但那的确足以进行合理的怀疑
But was that enough for reasonable doubt.

888
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,200
知道是什么害了你吗
You know what hurts you?

889
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,600
-轮胎里的钉子  -是的
- Nail in the tire. - Yep.

890
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,700
还有那过时的本田
And the old Honda.

891
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,770
这感觉不像是劫车案
It just doesn't feel like a carjacking.

892
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,340
像是谋杀伪造得像劫车案
It feels like a murder Made to look like a carjacking.

893
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,170
如果我不进行辩护会怎样
What if I don't fight it?

894
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,200
什么  承认这就是个谋杀吗
What, agree that it was just a murder?

895
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,900
那么陪审团就会要你指出一个嫌犯
Then the jury needs a suspect.

896
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,600
太晚了
It's late.

897
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,440
就像以前
It's like old times.

898
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,240
举证程序
Evidentiary procedure.

899
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,140
模拟审判
The mock trial.

900
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,070
你记得这个啊
You remember that?

901
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,270
我怎么会忘呢
How could I forget?

902
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,240
-那个案子我们输了吗  -是的
- Did we lose That one?  - Yeah!

903
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,970
福瑞克夫人  我只是想恭喜你
Um, Mrs. Florrick, I just want to say congratulations.

904
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,970
听说你在法庭上表现很好
I heard you did well in court.

905
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,270
谢谢  索尼娅
Thanks, Sonia.

906
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,400
索尼娅
Sonia.

907
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,300
要走了吗
Heading out?

908
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,630
是啊  我和委托人约了一起吃早餐
Yeah. I got a breakfast meeting with clients.

909
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,700
怎么了
What?

910
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,440
有点儿不对劲
Something just doesn't seem right.

911
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,430
-迈克尔跟前妻吃饭  -对
- Michael has dinner with his first wife.  - Right.

912
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,900
他对詹尼弗说非常想她
He tells Jennifer he missed her,

913
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,500
-怀念他们共度的时光  -是啊
- Missed her all life together.  - Right.

914
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,070
-辛迪会怎么想  -第二个老婆吗
- What does Cindy think about it?  - The second wife?

915
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,340
辛迪会想不开
Cindy thinks some unhappy thoughts.

916
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,390
陪审团会同情她
Jury liked her.

917
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,700
那就想办法让他们不同情
Get them not to.

918
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,900
辛迪的哥哥呢  你查出什么情况
What did you get on Cindy's brother?

919
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,970
这些是他的就业记录
These are his employment records.

920
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,280
很好  尸检报告呢
Good. What about the lab report?

921
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,910
这儿  不过他们会一直提出反对的
Here. But they're gonna object the whole way.

922
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,780
你得自己顺藤摸瓜
You'll need to just string together

923
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,640
-作出整理  -福瑞克律师
- Some implications.  - Mrs. Florrick

924
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,780
有空吗
You have a moment?

925
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,810
我们从前应该没见过
I don't think we've ever met before.

926
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,440
我是格伦·查尔兹
I'm Glenn Childs.

927
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,780
我们见过了
We've met.

928
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,610
你知道他在利用你  对吧
You know he's using you, don't you?

929
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,540
彼得以为是我把他搞下台的
Peter blames me for his downfall.

930
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,640
所以利用你来对付我
He's using you to get to me.

931
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,880
你怎么想到的
How do you figure?

932
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,210
福瑞克女士
Mrs. Florrick, please.

933
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,710
是他让你追查被掩埋的证据的
He told you about the pitted trace evidence.

934
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,610
别给自己惹祸上身
Don't make yourself collateral damage here,

935
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,840
这是为你自己好
For your own sake.

936
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
查尔兹先生
Mr. Childs,

937
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,880
那天你把性丑闻录像带交给了媒体
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press

938
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,710
让我不得不挡着孩子们
And forced me to shield my children

939
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,840
不让他们看到所有电视台节目里
From every cable news station that played it

940
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,640
每天24小时的滚动播出
In a 24-hour rotation,

941
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,510
从那时起  我已经有祸在身了
That was the day I became collateral damage.

942
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,510
如果你担心的是我丈夫  查尔兹先生
If you're worried about my husband, Mr. Childs,

943
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,280
那您以前明显没有真正激怒过女人
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.

944
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,740
出庭好运
Well, good luck in court.

945
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,210
刘易斯女士  你和死者
Mrs. Lewis, did you and the deceased

946
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,840
签过婚前协议吗
Sign a prenuptial agreement?

947
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,310
是的  税务原因
Uh, yes, for tax purposes.

948
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,210
所以我们假设死者要和你离婚
So if the deceased were to divorce you, let's say,

949
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,340
是为了和前妻重修旧好
In order to reunite with his first wife..

950
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,480
反对
Objection.

951
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
反对有效
Sustained.

952
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,840
如果死者要和你离婚
If the deceased were to divorce you,

953
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,140
你将无权获得死者的婚前财产
You would be cut off from his premarital savings,

954
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,380
-是这样吗  -反对
- Is that correct?  - Objection.

955
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,910
-与本案无关  -反对有效
- Relevance.  - Sustained.

956
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,240
请更换问题  福瑞克女士
Move it along, Mrs. Florrick.

957
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,710
刘易斯女士  您在证词中说
Mrs. Lewis, you stated in your testimony

958
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,880
案发当时
That you were in Miami

959
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,080
您在迈阿密
At the time of the shooting visiting family,

960
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,540
所以警方从未怀疑或询问过您
So the police never suspected or questioned you of the murder?

961
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,340
怀疑我是凶手吗  对  当然没有
Of the murder? No, of course not.

962
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,280
那您哥哥呢
What about your brother?

963
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,580
反对  法官大人  拜托
Objection! Your honor, come on,

964
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,410
辩方律师的整个讯问过程就是个烟雾弹
This whole line of questioning is a smokescreen.

965
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,880
布罗迪先生  我们还是先等等
Mr. Brody, why don't we wait

966
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,910
等真的有烟雾出来  再说这是烟雾弹吧
For a whiff of smoke before we call it a screen, please.

967
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,910
反对无效
I'll allow.

968
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,940
警方从未询问过您哥哥
The police never questioned your brother,

969
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,740
是吗  刘易斯女士
Isn't that correct, Mrs. Lewis?

970
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,580
他们没理由这么做
Well, they had no reason to.

971
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,840
因为他住在迈阿密吗
Because he lived in Miami?

972
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,010
因为丹尼与本案无关
Because Danny had nothing to do with this.

973
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,710
刘易斯女士  庭上已经接受了
Mrs. Lewis, the judge has admitted into evidence the buried...

974
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,840
留着吧
Strike that.

975
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,440
之前公布的证据作为本案的证据
...the previously unreleased trace evidence.

976
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,340
同时也接受了
He has also admitted into evidence

977
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,390
尸检出的一些意大利灵提的毛发
The crime lab's finding that these greyhound hairs were covered

978
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,380
上面有一种叫爱克托林的药物的残留物
In a chemical compound called Alco Ectolin.

979
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
您听说过吗
Have you heard of this?

980
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,080
不好意思  是一种药吗  没听过
Sorry, the chemical? No.

981
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,410
我也没听过
No, neither had I.

982
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,840
是一种外涂药剂
It is a lotion.

983
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,440
是涂在赛狗身上用来缓解...
It is a lotion that is used at dog racing tracks to ease...

984
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,340
-反对  跟证据不符  -反对有效
- Objection. Not in evidence. - Sustained.

985
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,880
布罗迪先生  你最好还是起立吧
And you might want to stay standing, Mr. Brody.

986
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,580
我有预感我们快看到你说的烟雾弹了
I have a feeling we're nearing your smokescreen.

987
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,810
刘易斯女士
Mrs. Lewis,

988
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,940
凶案发生一年前
Isn't it a fact

989
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,280
您哥哥在赛狗场工作过
That a year ago at the time of the murder,

990
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,040
这是事实吗
Your brother worked at a dog track?

991
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,110
反对
Objection!

992
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,140
反对有效
Sustained.

993
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,040
没有问题了
No further questions.

994
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,580
你还没喝呀
You're not just making this up?

995
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,480
拜托  喝之前还有一堆祝酒词呢
Come on it's still a lots of call tradition

996
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,380
为了首战告捷  敬你一杯
Your first jury trial-- shot of tequila.

997
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,810
喝吧
Let's go.

998
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,280
好吧
Okay.

999
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,440
我也干了
Yeah, I just made that up.

1000
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,940
声音真好听  不是吗
Sounded good, though,  didn't it?

1001
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,740
你猜陪审团会坚持多久
How long do you think they'll stay out?

1002
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,810
我很久以前就不猜这个了
Oh, I stopped guessing about juries a while ago.

1003
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,880
他们让你老公等了多长时间
How long were they out with your husband?

1004
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,010
6小时
Six hours.

1005
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,710
我有点不明白
You know what I don't get?

1006
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,780
你为什么还支持他
Why you stood by him.

1007
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,810
换了是我  我会一刀捅进他心脏
I would've stuck a knife in his heart

1008
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,110
我一直觉得我也该这样
I always thought I would, too.

1009
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,280
以前我听到人们的丑闻  想到那些老婆们时
But when I heard about those other scandals, the other wives...

1010
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,110
我还在想...
I thought...

1011
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,980
你们怎么能让自己这样被人利用
How can you allow yourself to be used like that?

1012
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,010
然后事情就发生在我自己身上了
And then it happened,

1013
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,310
我只是...
And I was...

1014
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,040
...没有准备好
...unprepared.

1015
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,740
你好
Hello?

1016
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,540
好的
Yes.

1017
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,140
谢谢
Thanks.

1018
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,280
陪审团到了吗
Jury's in?

1019
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,210
福瑞克律师
Well, Mrs. Florrick,

1020
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,940
芝加哥杀人案已经决定
Chicago homicide has decided

1021
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,580
重亲打开迈克尔·刘易斯遇害一案的

1022
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,010
调查记录
The murder of Michael Lewis

1023
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,380
布里格斯警官
Detective Briggs,

1024
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,010
做了一项令人钦佩的尽职调查
Doing an admirable amount of due diligence,

1025
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,280
已经确认辛迪·刘易斯的哥哥丹尼
Has confirmed that Cindy Lewis's brother Danny

1026
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,710
在案发的同一周
Had access to his employer's pickup truck

1027
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,980
钻进了他老板的小货车
The week of the murder.

1028
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,340
而那些已被采纳为证物的狗毛
And the dog hairs Admitted into evidence

1029
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,380
与在他工作地点找到的相吻合
Match those found at his workplace.

1030
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,480
所以我们的州检察官
So our State's attorney,

1031
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,180
凭借着他光芒四射的智慧
In his radiant wisdom,

1032
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,140
已经决定撤销对你客户的控告了
Has decided to withdraw the charges against your client

1033
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,240
并且立案侦查刘易斯先生弟弟的案件了
And pursue a case against Mrs. Lewis's brother.

1034
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,480
这样没错吧  布罗迪先生
Isn't that right, Mr. Brody?

1035
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,980
我只要听"是"或者"不是"
All I need is a yes or no.

1036
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
是
Yes.

1037
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,180
很好
Good.

1038
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,640
那我们可以结案了
Then we're done here.

1039
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,710
谢谢你  非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1040
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,040

No, it just went a little late, that's all.

1042

我做了烤肉  我在想
I made a pot roast, and I was wondering

1043
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,010
你回不回来吃晚饭
If you were coming home for dinner.

1044
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,340
怎么了  我说啥了
What? What did I say?

1045
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,410
没事  只是我过去也常常对彼得这么说
Nothing. It's just that's what I always used to say to Peter.

1046
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,840

Are you there?

杰姬  我不知道我以前是否说过
Jackie, I don't know if I've said this,

1050
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,310
但是  谢谢你  肯做出改进
But thank you... for stepping up.

1051
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,110
我当然会这么做  为啥不会
Of course I would. Why wouldn't I?

1052
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,540
待会儿见
I'll see you soon.

1053
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,310

All right, then.

1057
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,980

1061
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,980
还有件事
Oh, one more thing.

1062
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,980

我到现在都不敢相信

1072
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,410
律师认为我们翻案有很大胜算
The lawyers think we have a really good shot at overturning this,

1073
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,380
