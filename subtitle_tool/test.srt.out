?14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,970
早上好
一小时前  我辞去了库克县州检察官职务
我心情沉重
将与那些诽谤性指控抗争到底
我要强调
我从未滥用职权

Good morning.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
I did this with a heavy heart
And a deep commitment to fight these scurrilous charges.
I want to be clear.
I have never abused my office.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,400
我从未因钱色贿赂
而给人减刑
但是  我愧对妻子艾丽西娅和两个孩子
我要向他们赎罪
那些交易所涉款项  是我个人财产
全都是

I have never traded lighter sentences for financial
Or sexual favors.
At the same time, I need to atone for my personal failings
With my wife, Alicia, and our two children.
The money used in these transactions was mine...
And mine alone.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,000
我从未动用公款
但我承认
我与那些女人确实存在不正当关系
我和艾丽西娅
请求媒体尊重我们的隐私
给我们时间平复伤痛

No public funds were ever utilized.
But I do admit to a failure of
judgment in my privity with these women.
Alicia and I...
Ask that the press please respect our privacy.
Give us time to heal.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,570
有上帝的保佑和家人的宽恕
我相信能赢回他们的信任
我要感谢芝加哥民众
很荣幸为你们服务
我希望有朝一日
能再次为你们服务  谢谢

With the love of god, and the forgiveness of my family,
I know I can rebuild their trust.
I want to thank the people of Chicago.
It has been an honor to serve you.
And I pray that one day,
I may serve you again. Thank you.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,770
请问你和妓女还保持着关系吗
你与多少女人有染
你还会再担任公职吗
请回答
已经安排了《论坛报》和第四频道的采访
我绝对不再接受任何采访

Sir! Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?
How many were there, sir?
Will you ever try to hold public office again?
Sir! Answer the question!
We have interviews set up with the Tribune and Channel Four.
Absolutely not. I'm not doing any more interviews.

44
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,530
全都给我取消
我会告诉第二频道
我们现在无可奉告
但就此事的真实性深表怀疑
你没事吧
福瑞克夫人

I want you to cancel all of them. That's it.
I'll tell Channel Two
We don't have a comment at the present time.
But we emphatically question the authenticity of this thing.
You all right?
Mrs. Florrick, how long have you known

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,630
你何时知道丈夫有外遇的
你打算怎么保护你的孩子
请问  不是9点半开会吗
不是这间会议室  在楼上呢
天啊
这是一项大型集团诉讼

Your husband was having an affair?
How are you going to protect your children?
Excuse me, isn't the staff meeting at 9:30?
You're in the wrong conference room. It's up one floor.
God...
This is a major class action.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,190
能帮我们奠定顶级律所的地位
这对年终奖金的影响
不用我多说了吧
不过  谢弗林公司解聘了上一家律所
是因为他们不够专心
所以  除非另行通知

A case that could propel us to the top rank of full service firms,
And I don't think I need to remind you
What that will do to your year-end bonuses.
Anyway, Sheffrin-Marks fired their last firm
Because they took their eye off the ball.
So, until further notice,

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,040
你们的私生活全都取消了
你们有些人
要去帮着处理小客户案件
让我们的顶级律师腾出手来
艾迪  公路再分配案你去准备证词
东  布赖顿的犯人交给你了

Your personal lives have been cancelled.
So, we'll need some of you
To help out with the lower profile client work
To free up our top litigators.
Ed, you take the witness prep on highway redistribution.
Don, you take the Brighton criminal.

69
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,280
艾丽西娅负责那个法律援助案
其余人等
你们要给谢弗林公司展现我们最强大的能力
干活儿吧
威尔
艾丽西娅

And Alicia will take the pro bono.
Everyone else,
your task is to show sheffrin-marks our "A" game, okay?
Let's do this.
Will.
Alicia.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,100
抱歉没跟大家介绍一下你
这项集团诉讼忙坏我们了
我是要感谢你给我这个机会
简直救我一命
哪里  很高兴你能来
希望你能办好这个法律援助案

I'm sorry I didn't introduce you in there.
Everything's moving real fast with this class action.
Well, I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
It's a real life saver.
No, glad you could come aboard.
Hope you're all right with this pro bono.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,060
感觉怎么样
-很有意思  -很好
别紧张  你对枪弹残留没把握吗
那个...  天啊
铃声不错嘛  谁设的
是我婆婆  我女儿编写的

How'd it sound?
- Interesting.  - Good.
Don't be nervous. You worried about the gunshot residue?
The, um... Oh, god.
Nice ring tone. Who gets that?
Oh, my mother-in-law. My daughter programmed it.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
你的呢
别提啦
关于枪弹残留...
戴安  你给艾丽西娅介绍下情况吧
很好  她来我就放心了
抓紧做  然后吃晚饭

And what's yours?
I don't want to know.
So, um, the gun residue...
Diane, you're briefing Alicia, right?
Good. You're in good hands.
So, let's catch up, have dinner.

93
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,830
威尔对你评价很高
他说你从乔治城大学毕业时  是班里第一名
啥时候毕业的
-15年前  -哦
然后你在哪儿干了2年来着
高诗雅  埃布拉姆斯 & 阿博特律所

So, Will speaks highly of you.
He says you graduated top of your class at Georgetown.
When was this?
-15 years ago. - Uh-huh.
And you spent two years at...
Crozier, Abrams & Abbott.

99
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,610
这律所不错
威尔说  你在那儿完成的计费工时是最多的
后来为啥不干了
因为孩子  还有彼得的工作
布莱恩  把卷宗给福瑞克女士
好的

Good firm.
Will says you clocked the highest billable hours there.
Why did you leave?
Well, the kids and Peter's career.
Brian! Can you get Mrs. Florrick the files?
Mm-hmm. Sure.

105
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,430
你就把我当作导师吧  艾丽西娅
这和镇上的校友关系
是最相似的
女人帮助女人  可以吗
好的
我出道时  听过一条很棒的建议

I want you to think of me as a mentor, Alicia.
It's the closest thing we have
To an old boys' network in this town.
Women helping women, okay?
Okay.
When I was starting out, I got one great piece of advice.

111
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
男人可以懒惰  女人不行
这句话对你加倍适用
不仅是因为
你重返工作岗位太晚
而且你还有很不好的名声
但既然她能扛住  你也能

Men can be lazy. Women can't.
And I think that goes double for you.
Not only are you
Coming back to the workplace fairly late,
But you have some very prominent baggage.
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,000
多谢  布莱恩
和很多律所一样  我们工时的5%
献给法律援助案
很遗憾  这案子早就超过我的工时量了
詹妮弗?刘易斯  26岁
教二年级

Thanks, Brian.
Like many law firms, we donate five percent
Of billable hours to pro bono.
Sadly, I'm long past my quote on this one.
Jennifer Lewis. 26 years old.
Taught second grade.

123
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,700
被控谋杀其前夫
起诉方以为能让她稳坐45年牢
但是陪审团上周却陷入僵局
六个陪审员投票她有罪  六个投没有
我甚至不明白为什么州检察官
要再次审判  除非他想要...维持正义

Accused of killing her ex-husband.
Prosecution thought it was a slam dunk 45 years,
But the jury came back last week deadlocked.
Six jurors voted to convict, six not.
I'm not even sure why the state attorney
Is re-trying except he wants... justice!

129
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,360
他想证明自己  所以你要延用
我第一次审讯时的策略  警察在调查中
过早地锁定了詹妮弗
而根本没找过那个劫车人
所以  让陪审团再次陷入僵局
他们不可能再陷入僵局了  明白吗

He wants to prove himself. So, stick with my strategy
From the first trial. The police focused
On Jennifer so early in the investigation,
They never even looked for the carjacker.
Deadlock a jury a second time,
They'll never re-try a third. Okay?

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,630
好  我们的调查员会帮你赶上
3点的保释听证会
科马克  我准备好了
听证会是今天吗
也可以推迟  但是那样
詹妮弗就得再监禁一个月

Okay, our investigator can get you up to speed
For the bail hearing at 3:00.
Cormac, I'm ready.
The hearing's today?
Well, we could delay, but that would leave
Jennifer incarcerated for another month.

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
别担心  没事的
美国教育机构不会反对保释的
走  10点半开会
但我承认私下里同这些女人打交道时
没有把持住
对不起

Don't worry. You'll be fine.
The ASA's not going to argue against a recognizance release.
Let's go. Meeting's at 10:30.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment
In my private dealings with these women...
Sorry.

147
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,300
...是我个人财产  全都是
从没未动用公款
最新消息...
我来帮你
不用  我可以
没事  反正我也要去那边

...Mine and mine alone.
No public funds were ever utilized.
The recent news...
Oh, hey. Let me help you with that.
No, I'm fine.
No, no, I'm heading that way anyway.

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,860
我是凯里  另一个新来的副手
我记得你  我是艾丽西娅
我知道我们俩会是竞争对手
但是我只是想说
我真的很敬佩你的能力
既能照顾家里  又能投身到工作中

I'm Cary, the other new associate.
Oh, right. Alicia.
Yeah, look, I know we should be at each other's throats,
But I just want to say I really
Respect what you doing here,
Raising a family and then jumping right back into this.

159
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,200
我妈妈  她也想像你这样
-很好  -是啊
你跟了法律援助案吧
太棒了
去年暑假我还参加了无罪计划的实习
我爸最好的朋友是巴瑞?谢克

My mom, she's thinking of doing the same thing.
- Great. - Yeah.
So, you're on the pro bono, right?
Yeah, that's great.
I interned last summer at the innocence project.
My dad's best friend is Barry Scheck

165
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,060
感觉太棒了
帮助别人  所以他们让我来谢弗林公司上班
这肯定很有挑战性
但是一天过去了  你都做了些什么
为公司节省了几百亿吗
你想交换吗

And it was just amazing.
Helping people. Here, they got me on the sheffrin-marks.
I'm sure it will be challenging,
But at the end of the day, what have you really done?
Saved a corporation a few billion dollars?
You want to trade?

171
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,960
我也想啊  但是貌似他们另有安排
凯里  我差不多了  拿铁在你桌上
-谢谢  -你好  福瑞克夫人
貌似我们共用一个助手
如果我霸占她了就跟我说  好吗
胜利属于强者

I would, but I guess they have other plans, so...
I am almost done, Cary. The latte's on your desk.
-Thank you.- Hi, Mrs. Florrick.
Looks like we share an assistant,
So tell me when I'm hogging her, okay?
And let the best man win.

177
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,730
你说什么
胜利...
没什么
没什么  我...
没什么
不好意思

Excuse me?
Uh, let the...
Nothing.
It's nothing. I...
It's nothing.
Oops.

183
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,130
没紧张  是你办公室
我是凯琳达?夏尔马  自己人
就是那个调查员
你是彼得?福瑞克的夫人
是的
我在州检察官办公室干了3年

Don't worry, it's yours.
Kalinda Sharma. I'm the in-house.
Oh, the investigator.
You're peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.
I worked with him at the state's attorney's office three years

189
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,300
却被他开除了
好吧
你都知道些什么
客户是个二年级老师
-詹妮弗...  -刘易斯
因谋杀她前夫被捕

He fired me.
Okay
So, what do you know?
The client is a second- grade school teacher.
- Jennifer...- Lewis.
She was arrested for killing her ex-husband.

195
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,700
掩饰成了汽车劫案
发现在詹妮弗的
脸上还有手上有枪弹残留
于是警察认定那是
掩饰成劫车案的谋杀
他们认为  詹妮弗枪杀了她前夫

Making it look like a botched carjacking.
Gunshot residue
Was found on Jennifer's face and hands.
That's why the cops started to think it was a murder
Disguised as a carjacking.
According to them, Jennifer shot her ex-husband

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,490
-然后把枪擦了干净  -动机呢
他已经再婚  并且想争夺三岁孩子的监护权
目击者称  案发前一周见过他们争吵
妈咪  快接电话
妈咪  快接电话
-妈咪  快...  -不好意思  是我女儿

- And wiped down the gun. - And the motive?
He remarried and wanted custody of the three-year-old.
Witnesses saw them arguing a week before the murder.
Hey, mom. Pick up the phone.
hey, mom. Pick up the phone.
- Hey, mom. Pick up... - Sorry, that's my daughter.

207
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,700
喂  格雷斯
妈妈  我想问你个问题
但是别惊慌  好吗
算了  我还是问扎克吧
-别别  什么事  -好吧
有女生说我爸和妙龄妓女上床  我...

Hi, Grace.
Hey, mom. I want to ask you a question,
But I don't want you to freak out, okay?
Forget it. I'll ask Zach.
- No, no, no. what? - All right, well,
Some girl said dad slept with a hooker my age. and I just...

213
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,200
-什么  -女士  请把手机关掉
他们还在电脑室放录像
那女生还说
她爸是警察  他说其中一个妓女
还不满20岁
首先  她们都满了20岁了

- What? - Ma'am, you'll have to turn that off.
They were playing the tape in the computer lab.
And some girl said
Her dad's a cop and he said one of the hookers
Was a teenager.
Okay, first of all, they were all over 20 and second,

219
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
其次  老师在哪
没什么  妈  我去写作业了
晚点再跟你说
怎么了
我上一次进法庭是13年前的事了
那时我才12岁

Where's the teacher?
It's no big deal, mom. look, I've got homework.
I'll talk to you later.
What?
Last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
Wow. I was 12.

225
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,860
谢谢夸奖
法官把手伸到他袋里
拿出一张支票  递给原告
"我还回你5000美元  稍后"
那是福瑞克的妻子
艾丽西娅  我的天

Thanks.
The judge reaches into his pocket,
Pulls out a check, handing it to the plaintiff.
"I'm returning five grand and we're going to decide this."
That's Florrick's wife.
Alicia? My god.

231
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,030
马坦  记得吗  在部门的圣诞晚会上
你现在在斯特恩  洛克哈特&加德纳律所做事吗
是啊  第一天上班
这位是桑德拉?佩  是新手
彼得离开后加入的
顺便问下  他最近怎样

Matan, remember? From the department christmas party.
You're at Stern, Lockhart & Gardner?
Yeah. First day.
This is Sandra Pai. She's new.
Since Peter...
How's he doing, by the way?

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,600
彼得吗  他很好
替我问候他  好吗
看看这些
你打算击败我们了
我不知道你怎么办到的  艾丽西娅
换成我  早缩在角落里不出来丢人了

Peter? Fine.
Say hello for me, will you?
Look at all this.
You're going to bury us.
I don't know how you do it, Alicia.
I'd be huddled up in a ball somewhere.

243
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,600
工作吧
祝你好运
戴安呢
戴安叫全权负责这起案件
詹妮弗  我是艾丽西娅?福瑞克
是律所的另一位律师

Well, back to work.
Good luck.
Where's Diane?
Diane asked me to step in for her.
Jennifer, I'm Alicia Florrick.
I'm one of the other lawyers with the firm.

249
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,260
插手吗  多久啊
整个重审阶段
天哪
全体起立
女士
库克县刑事法庭

Step in? For how long?
For the retrial.
My god
All rise.
Ma'am.
The criminal court

255
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,660
现在开庭
由尊敬的法官理查德?奎斯特主持庭审
请坐
好吧  让我们先来听下双方陈述
尊敬的法官大人  我刚刚
尊敬的法官大人  请您回顾一下

Of Cook County is now in session,
The honorable judge Richard Cuesta presiding.
Be seated.
Okay, let's hear it.
Your honor, I just...
Your honor, just to refresh your memory,

261
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,390
被告被视为畏罪潜逃
因为她在先前的监护权听证会上
企图携其女儿潜逃
可是上周陪审团就这起谋杀案投票
结果是六票对六票的僵局  布罗迪先生
我知道我们的新州检察官

The accused was deemed a flight risk
Due to an earlier custody hearing
In which she threatened to run off with her daughter.
And yet just last week a jury deadlocked
On these murder charges six to six, Mr.Brody.
Now I know our new state's attorney

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,520
想看上去强硬些  但是为何要重审此案呢
法官大人  我只想...
大家都准备好
开始重审了  法官大人
如果福瑞克女士
坚持要替委托人洗脱罪名

Wants to look tough, but why are you fighting this?
Your honor, I just wanted to...
The people are prepared to
Retry this case right now, your honor.
If Mrs. Florrick
Is so intent on getting her client out,

273
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,450
为何她不赞成快速审判呢
-福瑞克女士  -是的  法官大人
受人尊敬的彼得?福瑞克的妻子
你丈夫和我向来
意见相悖  女士
法官大人

Why doesn't she agree to a speedy trial?
- Mrs.Florrick? - Yes, your honor.
The wife of the esteemed Peter Florrick?
Your husband and I never quite
Saw eye to eye, ma'am
Your honor

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,620
福瑞克女士  听我说
倘若原告认为这在某些方面
会使我对你的委托人存有偏见的话
他就大错特错了
省点力吧  马坦
所以刘易斯女士理所应当

Mrs. Florrick, don't talk.
But if the prosecution thinks that this will in some way
Prejudice me against your client,
He is sorely mistaken.
Nice try, Matan.
So Ms.Lewis is granted

285
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,620
审前释放
通过电子追踪器
她的行动会被受限于临时住所
以及代理人办公室之间
鉴于这是重审
我把再审日期定在25号

Pretrial release
With electronic monitoring.
She is restricted to temporary housing,
Attorney's offices, and transit in between.
And given that this is a rerun,
I'll set the trial date for the 25th.

291
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,180
现在  都满意了吧  很好
谢谢你
没什么
我们曾处得很好
迈克尔说他想女儿
想我们在一起的时光

Now, are we all happy? Good.
Thank you.
Sure.
We had a nice time
Michael talked about missing his daughter,
The life we had together.

297
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,950
我们正开车回家
接着
爆胎了
他出去修理
然后我看到
一辆红色敞篷卡车

We were driving home
And, uh...
...we got a flat.
He was getting out to fix it,
And i saw...
A red pickup truck.

303
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,050
有个人走近了迈克尔
本来我没看见枪
直到
迈克尔
迈克尔
我看到迈克尔的脸

A man came up to Michael.
I didn't see the gun
Until...
Michael!
Michael!
And I saw Michael's face.

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,520
已经...
要不要休息一下
不用了
可以的话给我瓶水
当然
索尼娅  拿瓶水

It was, um...
Do you need to take a break?
Uh, no.
Just-- if there was some water.
Sure.
Sonia, we need some water in here.

315
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
5分钟后送来
我还得上楼帮他做份同行比对
好吧  你做好了告诉我
你说这人从这里跑到红色卡车那儿
接着从这方向穿过停车场离开
这里有监视器

It's going to be about five minutes,
But then I've got to do his depo upstairs.
Okay, uh, tell me when you're done.
You say this man ran to a red pickup truck here,
And took off in this direction across the parking lot.
There's a surveillance camera here.

321
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,000
原告播放了录像  证明你在说谎
我没说谎
但是带子上根本没有卡车
这就是为何你正面临
重审而不是无罪释放
我认为凯琳达想说的是  詹妮弗

And the prosecution played it to make you look like a liar.
I'm not lying.
But there's no truck on the tape.
And that's why you're facing a
Retrial now and not an acquittal
I think what Kalinda is trying to say, Jennifer...

327
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,630
是否有可能是你自己搞错了
那车开了这条路  而不是那条
你女儿吗
他们不准我看她
监护权在迈克尔父母手里
我该怎么办

...is, is it possible that you were mistaken
And that the car went this way-- not that way?
Is that your daughter?
They won't let me see her.
Michael's parents have custody.
What am I going to do?

333
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,100
总有一天你会拿回监护权的
我们给你安排了住所
你先去那里
洗个澡  好好睡一觉
不要看电视
喜欢看书吗

You're going to take it one day at a time.
We got you housing.
You're going to go there,
Take a shower, take a nap.
Don't turn on the tv.
You like reading?

339
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,000
我会拿点书给你
小说最合适
你可能不想  但还是要好好打扮下
勉强一下
不是为了上庭
为了自己

I'm going to get you some books.
Fiction is best.
You won't feel like it, but put on nice clothes and makeup.
Force yourself to.
Not for court--
For you.

345
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,430
现在表面工作才最关键
这能让案子有点起色吗
不会
但你会感觉好点
怎么了
如果你老是这么感情用事  迟早会受不了

It's the superficial things that matter most right now.
Does it ever get easier?
No.
But you do get better at it.
What?
If you identify with too many clients, you burn out.

351
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,270
等我有什么事做对了你再提醒我  好吗
没问题
陪审员那边就交给你了
而我则去查查监视镜头是怎么回事儿
没错  我曾是陪审团主席
希望你不介意回答我们几个问题  医生

Why don't you tell me when I do something right, okay?
Sure.
You go and interview the jurors
And I'll try to figure out how a surveillance camera can lie.
That's right. I was the jury foreman.
And you don't mind answering a few questions for us, doctor?

357
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,560
以助于我们在重审中更好地扭转乾坤
没问题
我不认为可以扭转乾坤
此案事实清楚  证据确凿
老实说  我觉得根本没必要对当事人进行重审
我从头到尾都投得是赞成票

It'll help us refine the case for the retrial.
No problem.
I don't think you'll need much refining.
Your case was very strong, very logical.
In fact, I'm not even sure why the other side went to trial.
I voted for conviction right from the start.

363
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,520
好极了
你  你是指  无罪吗
不  是有罪
但我是辩方律师
根本就没什么小卡车  她在说谎
她手上还有枪弹残留

Good.
You-you mean, acquittal.
No, conviction.
But I'm with the defense.
She was lying about the pickup truck.
She had the gunshot residue on her hands.

369
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,790
能透露下由始至终都投有罪有多少人吗
-11票  -什么
但有一个始终坚持认为无罪
就是九号陪审员
我们还跟她争论了三天
但法官说投票结果是

Can I ask you how many voted for conviction from the start, sir?
- Eleven.- what?
There was only one holdout.
Juror number nine.
We argued with her for three days.
But the judge polled the jury

375
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,760
是六对六陷入了僵局啊
没错  法官只能宣布我们僵持不下
因为我们故意均衡了投票
我们中的几个陪审员改变投票
只是为了可以早日离开那儿
如果不是九号陪审员

And they deadlocked six to six.
Yes, well, the judge would only declare us deadlocked
If we were evenly split.
So some of us agreed to change our vote
To not guilty just to get out of there.
If it hadn't been for juror number nine

381
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,920
我们早就达成一致  判其有罪了
她说服不了我们又不肯妥协  大家都受不了了
不要帮我准备茶了  道瑞斯基夫人
不用客气
听其他陪审员说
您就是那位一直固执己见的人  对吗

We would have convicted.
She didn't convince us. she exhausted us.
No tea for me, Mrs. Duretsky.
Suit yourself.
So the other jurors
Said you were a holdout. Is that correct?

387
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,020
他们全都觉得自己精明完了
同意我观点的票数却刚好跟他们一样
究竟是什么让你这么确信被告无罪呢
其实  老实说
我看人一向很准  只需一眼就能辩其好坏
那姑娘  我一眼就喜欢上她了

They all thought they were so much smarter than me.
My vote counted just as much as theirs.
What exactly in the defense's case convinced you?
Well, the whole thing, really.
I tend to look at a person and size them up pretty quickly.
That lady, I liked her.

393
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,380
是说被告  詹妮弗吗
不  是辩方律师
她从不对人摆架子
我就喜欢这样的人
我只是想弄明白
辩护方提出詹妮弗手上的枪弹残留

The defendant, Jennifer?
No, that lawyer lady.
She never put on airs.
I like that.
Just so I'm clear.
The defense expert argued that the gunshot residue

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,430
是因为和第三人抗争所留
-噢  我的小乖乖  -是你一直坚守无罪的原因吗
我根本就不知道你说得是啥
我不过是感情用事罢了
对吗  赛勒斯
杰姬

On Jennifer's hands came from the struggle.
- Oh, so sweet. - Is that why you held out?
Oh, I don't know about that.
I just tend to get a feeling.
Don't I, Cyrus?
Hi, Jackie.

405
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,020
-怎么啦  -没什么
我刚刚看了下要洗的衣服
发现有格雷斯的有些校服
不太合适
我们刚刚搬了家
格雷斯离开了所有好友

- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
I was going through the laundry
And I think some of Grace's school clothes
You would find inappropriate.
We just moved away.
Grace has left all her friends.

411
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,020
我希望你能多陪陪她
我要说的是
我可以带她去逛逛  帮她选条长裤
选条能衬得她更苗条又漂亮的
她体重完全符合健康标准
我可不希望她整天尽想着减肥美体

I need you to go easier on her.
All I said was
I could take her shopping and help her find pants
That would make her look slimmer.
She's at a perfectly healthy weight.
I don't want her to have body image issues.

417
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,750
她迟早都会想的
如果她的体重再一路飙升的话
艾丽西娅
等我回家了我们再继续这个话题  好吗
-好的  -再见
你知道新员工凯里这个人吗

She'll only have body image issues
If she keeps gaining weight.
Alicia.
Um, we'll talk about this when I get home later, okay?
- All right. - Bye.
You know the new associate Cary?

423
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,580
那个穿布里奥尼的家伙吗
干嘛  我可是个非常善于观察的人呢
没错  正是那个穿布里奥尼的家伙
他对我说"胜利属于强者"
那究竟是什么意思
我想他应该是指

The one in the brioni?
What? I'm observant.
Yes, the one in the brioni.
He said to me, "may the best man win."
What exactly does he mean by that?
What he means is something

429
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,050
我们没对你坦白
坦白什么
听着  我们只有一个副职的空缺
所以我们打算同时聘用两个应聘者
然后在六个月之内决定谁去谁留
如此说来  我得和凯里一争高下了

I thought we weren't making public.
What?
Look, we only have one associate position open.
So we agreed to hire two applicants,
And in six months decide which one to retain.
So this is a contest between me and Cary?

435
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,720
说得再难听点儿  这是场生死大战
我只是希望你的法律援助案顺利
探视时间快结束了
听他们说有位探访者
我还以为是妈妈
我一直很忙

It was either that or a cage match.
I'm just happy your pro bono's going well.
Visiting hours are almost over.
They said a visitor.
I thought mom.
I've been busy.

441
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,510
很高兴见到你
我需要你签几样东西
没问题
房子里的东西我没能都拿走
市场不景气  不好卖
我明白

It's good to see you.
I need you to sign some things.
Okay.
We didn't get everything we wanted on the house.
It's a bad market to sell.
I see that.

447
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,130
大部分费用都花在了你的诉讼费上
而我的薪水得用来支付房租
孩子们也不得不去公立学校就读
他们怎么样了
妈妈说她现在帮着打理家务
他们都很好

We used most of it for your court costs.
The rent will come out of my salary
And the kids are going to have to stay in public school.
How are they?
Mother says that she's helping out around the house.
They're good.

453
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,620
格雷斯总会因为衣服和你妈妈争论不休
扎克也会利用你在学校交到朋友了
我都不知道这该说是好事
还是坏事
利用我
Funnyordie网站上有关于你的片段

Grace argues over clothes with your mother,
And Zach is using you to make friends at school.
Which I don't know if that's a healthy thing
Or something worse.
Using me?
Funnyordie has a skit about you.

459
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,320
我想  对他而言这是件很酷的事儿
瞧瞧吧
艾丽西娅  我知道这让你倍受煎熬
但你得相信我
我是清白的
关于挪用公款这事

It's cool, I guess.
Here.
Alicia, I know this has been hard on you,
But you have to believe me.
I'm innocent...
Of the abuse of office charges.

465
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,330
你以为我会相信你的鬼话吗  彼得
他们在格雷斯电脑室里放了一段
你吮吸一个妓女脚趾头的录像
你以为我会在乎你们雇佣合同里
那些附属细则吗
听我说  我是被陷害的  州检察官

You think I give a damn about that, Peter?
They were playing a tape in Grace's computer lab
Of you sucking the toes of a hooker.
You think I care about the small print
In your employment contract?
Come on, I was set up. the state attorneys...

471
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,130
得了吧  彼得  我不想再费唇舌了
我不会和你吵架
我来这里不是和你吵架的
妈妈说你接手了一个案子
恭喜
是那个伪装劫车案吗

Oh, come on, Peter. I don't want to talk...!
I'm not going to fight.
I didn't come here to fight.
Mom says you're on a case.
Congratulations.
The fake carjacking, right?

477
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,630
法官是谁
理查德?奎斯特
你不是在开玩笑吧
他和我有仇
我知道
探访时间到了

Who's the judge?
Richard Cuesta.
You're kidding.
He hates me.
I know.
Visiting hours are now over.

483
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,030
探访时间到了
你知道这个案子有
些许蹊跷  不是吗
那个刘易斯案件
有流言称
有些证据被掩盖了  埋没了

Visiting hours are now over.
You know there was something weird
about that case, don't you?
The Lewis case?
There was a rumor going around
That something got buried, pitted.

489
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,330
什么东西
证物
或是证词
我该走了
听着
谢谢你这么久操劳家计

What?
Evidence
Or testimony.
I should go.
Hey, listen,
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.

495
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,560
我不会让你永远这么辛劳的
我的律师认为受理上诉的法院
愿意听证我的案子
如果他们改判  所有事情都会回到原样
是时候走了
彼得

It's not going to last forever.
The lawyers think the appellate court
Is going to hear my case.
If they overturn it, everything goes back to normal.
It's time.
Peter,

501
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,660
永远不可能回到原样了
警方一发现詹妮弗手中枪弹残留
就断定她是嫌疑人
那如果他们忽视了其他的细节呢
如果他们并没有忽视呢
在这儿争论毫无意义

It's never going back to normal.
As soon as the cops found gunshot residue
On Jennifer's hands, they had their suspect.
So what if they pitted everything else?
And what if they didn't?
Arguments are cheap.

507
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,670
那是什么
犯罪实验室分析结果综述第一页
我仔细看了才发现证据  看左上角
看起来像个订书钉
确实是订书钉
这很奇怪因为

What's that?
Page one of the crime lab summary.
I was digging through discovery. Look at the top corner.
Looks like a staple.
It is a staple.
And that's odd because...?

513
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,940
没有第二页
如果没有第二页
他们为什么要用订书钉
你认为警方隐瞒了一些指向另外一个
嫌疑人的证据
我认为他们做了  要不就在法庭上

There's no page two.
Why do they need a staple
If there's no page two?
You think the cops kept something out of the discovery
That pointed to another suspect?
Well, I think either they did or it would be helpful

519
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,540
暗示他们做了
离开庭还有两天
你却想放弃原先的策略
戴安仅仅说服了养猫老妇被告无罪
一辆卡车被人看到疾驰
穿过灯光明亮  空荡荡的停车场

In court to imply that they did.
Two days away from trial
And you're thinking of dropping the old strategy?
Diane barely convinced a cat lady to acquit.
So, a pickup truck is seen racing
Through a well-lit, empty parking lot.

525
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,410
一辆卡车怎么可能从监控摄像头下溜走呢
标记错误时间的监控录像
有了
你在做什么
工作
这可比传票强多了

How is a truck missed by that surveillance camera?
Mismarked surveillance tape.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Working.
These are better than subpoenas.

531
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,310
我们只需要弄清监控系统的运作方式
我们五分钟就可以搞定走人了
-五分钟  -是的
好的  这里往下走就到了
我丈夫为什么要炒你鱿鱼
他指责我干了两份活

We just need to see how the surveillance system works,
And we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.
- Five minutes? - Uh-huh.
Okay, it's down here.
Why did my husband fire you?
He accused me of working two jobs.

537
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,280
你有吗
是的
瞧  计算机自动录下了监控记录
并标注了日期时间
-那是谋杀当晚的录像吗  -是的
就算是计算机错误地标注了日期时间

Were you?
Oh, yeah.
See, the computer automatically records the surveillance.
Marks it with date and time.
- Is that the night of the murder? - Yeah.
I mean, even if the computer did mismark it,

543
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,550
我在停车场巡视了一小时
没有看到小卡车
瞧  那个人就是我
十一点零三分  就在谋杀案发生前
我们可以拿一份拷贝吗
当然可以

I make an hourly tour of the lot,
And I didn't see no pickup truck.
Look, that's me.
11:03, just before the murder.
Can we get copies of these?
Sure.

549
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,910
蕾妮
蕾妮
什么事
给我拿几个磁盘
好的
你的机器多吐出一罐可乐

Lanie?
Lanie?!
What?
Get me some disks.
All right.
Your machine spit out an extra one.

555
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,550
你要喝吗
多漂亮的孩子啊
一对儿女  一对儿孙女
蕾妮  那些磁盘怎么样了
他总是这么可爱吗
他只是个懒散的商场保安

Would you like it?
Oh, what beautiful children.
Two kids, two grandkids.
Hey, Lanie, how about those disks?!
Is he always so charming?
Oh, he's just a lazy mall cop.

561
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,430
他要花半天时间看黄色录像
而到了值夜班的时候
他就赖在椅子上了
总是要我早上去叫醒他
男人啊
我和彼得谈过  他说你去看他了

He spends half the day surfing porn,
And with night shift,
He can't get his skinny ass out of his chair.
I'm always waking him up in the morning.
Oh! Men.
I talked to Peter. He said you dropped by.

567
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,540
我去了
我很高兴
他在那里倍受煎熬
他很勇敢
但他在受煎熬
他需要你的原谅  艾丽西娅

I did.
I'm glad.
He's hurting in there.
He's very brave.
But he's hurting.
He needs you to forgive him, Alicia.

573
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,200
杰姬
我给他当了15年的洗衣娘
打扫他的房间
从来没有任何质疑
因为我觉得没什么好质疑的
他带走了我们的全部共同财产

Jackie,
I spent 15 years doing his laundry,
Cleaning his house,
Never asking a single question
Because I didn't think I had to.
And he took everything I thought we had

579
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,100
然后送给了每一个人
他也不想的
那种压力...
杰姬
别说了  彼得根本没替我们着想
这需要时间  艾丽西娅

And he just put it out there for everyone.
He didn't want that.
The press...
Oh, Jackie,
Stop it, please! Peter wasn't thinking of us.
It takes time, Alicia.

585
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,870
给他点时间
我现在的时间都放在这些锅碗瓢盆上了
我想让她死
我也是  只是时候未到
那为什么扎克和我不能自己照顾自己
亲爱的  她每天只在这里呆几个小时

Give it time.
Any time I have right now is for them.
I want her dead.
Me, too, just not quite yet.
So why can't Zach and I just watch ourselves?
Honey, she's only here a couple of hours a day.

591
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,330
杀伤力极强的几小时
你能应付的
把她的来电铃声换了
请报出您的姓名
辛迪?刘易斯
你嫁给被害人多久了

A couple very damaging hours.
You'll heal.
And change her ring tone.
Please state your name.
Cindy Lewis.
And you were married to the victim

597
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,430
刘易斯太太
快2年了
-谢谢  -你认为
你丈夫和他前妻的关系如何
通常情况下都不错  甚至很友好
但在最后一次听证会后

For how long, Mrs. Lewis?
Two years until...
- Thank you. - And how would you describe
Your husband's relationship with his first wife?
Well, most of the time it was fine, friendly even,
But after the last custody hearing,

603
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,330
迈克尔为詹妮弗而感到担忧
反对 法官大人
反对理由
无事实依据
理由不错  福瑞克律师  反对无效
继续  刘易斯太太

Michael was pretty worried about Jennifer...
Objection, your honor.
On what grounds?
Hearsay.
Nice try, Mrs. Florrick. I'll allow it.
Go ahead, Mrs. Lewis.

609
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,330
他担心詹妮弗意图要
得到单方监护权
谢谢  刘易斯太太
辩方律师
刘易斯太太  你说迈克尔担心詹尼弗
然而在接下来的一周

Um, he was worried jennifer was intent
On getting sole custody.
Thank you, Mrs. Lewis.
Your witness.
Now, Mrs. Lewis, you stated that Michael was worried
About Jennifer, yet in the week following...

615
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,200
反对 法官大人
反对有效
刘易斯太太  你声称
詹尼弗想得到单方监护权
但是否...
-反对  -反对有效

Objection, your honor.
Sustained.
In your testimony, Mrs. Lewis, you claimed
That Jennifer wanted sole custody,
But isn't it true...?
- Objection.  - Sustained.

621
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,300
继续试  福瑞克律师  你会问到重点的
刘易斯太太
是谁提出去吃晚饭的
詹妮弗还是迈克尔
迈克尔
这难道不能表明

Keep trying, Mrs. Florrick. you'll hit on it.
Mrs. Lewis,
Whose idea was it to have dinner,
Jennifer's or Michael's?
Michael's.
So wouldn't that suggest

627
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,630
他的态度已经有所转变了吗
反对
反对有效
谢谢
冷静点
布里格斯警官  辩方提到案发当时

That his attitude had changed towards...?
Objection.
Sustained.
Thank you.
Clam down
Now, detective Briggs, the defense has referred

633
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,230
在案发点附近有三起未破获的劫车案
-您知道此事吗  -知道
那您怎么知道本案
不是又一起连环劫车案呢
首先  被抢的都是豪华汽车
一辆雷克萨斯和两辆宝马

To three unsolved carjackings in the neighborhood at that time.
- Are you aware of this?  - I am.
So why didn't you consider this incident
To be another in that series of carjackings?
Firse of all are luxury cars
One LEXUS and two BMWs.

639
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,430
而本案被害人驾驶的是2001款的本田
并且燃油管上没发现剪切的痕迹
劫车者通常都会剪切燃油管
来使豪华车抛锚
没错
但本案受害人只是因为车胎漏气了

The victim in this crime was driving a 2001 Honda,
And there was no clip on the fuel line.
This is what the carjackers did
To force the luxury cars over.
That's right.
But in the case of the honda, the victim pulled over

645
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,100
才将本田停在了路边
是的 女士 我们在车的前轮上
发现一枚钉子
明白了  那为什么劫车者
就不会选用钉子呢  探长
那只会适得其反

Because he had a flat.
Yes, ma'am, there was a nail driven
Into the front driver tire.
I see. now, why is this something
A carjacker would never do, detective?
It would defeat the purpose.

651
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,400
车胎都漏气了  你还怎么偷车
辩方律师
情况并不乐观  对吗
现在还言之尚早
福瑞克律师
布里格斯警官  "坑"是什么意思

I mean, how do you steal a car with a flat?
Your witness.
It's not going well, is it?
It's early.
Mrs. Florrick?
Detective Briggs, what is "the pit"?

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,300
你说什么
在警界  "坑"是指什么
反对  法官大人
反对理由
理由是...引导证人
那我们来看看能引导到什么程度好了

Excuse me?
In police circles, what is "the pit"?
Objection, your honor.
On what grounds?
On the grounds that... relevance.
Well, let us see how relevant this becomes, Shall we?

663
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,530
警官
"坑"是...
是警局的暗语
是指被认为与犯罪现场无关的证据
所以  如果说一名警官提到要将某样东西
丢到"坑"里  或是要让它变成"坑"

Detective?
The pit...
The pit is police slang
For evidence thought irrelevant at a crime scene.
So when an officer's referring to dropping something
In "the pit," or "pitting it,"

669
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,630
他是指什么
是指将这件东西从犯罪现场排除
但我们排除的都是不相关的资料
我们是不会排除与案件有关的证据的
在刘易斯案中有没有证据被排除
法官大人  反对

he refers to what?
Excluding it from the crime scene narrative.
But that only applies to irrelevant details.
We wouldn't exclude pertinent evidence.
Was anything pitted from the Lewis crime...?
Your honor, objection!

675
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,400
证据一直都是登记在案的
这证明了新的发现与本案无关
我这不是为了混淆视听
只是想尝试解读真相
我们并不知道这是否...
我还要指责辩方没有提供任何一条

Evidence is logged in all the time
That proves irrelevant to the discovery.
It's not an intent to deceive.
It's an attempt to decipher facts.
We don't even know if it is...
And to blame the prosecution for not coming up with every

681
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,670
-有依据的信息  -她只是抓住案子
-的重点  -够了  福瑞克律师
这些内容都没有在初审的时候提出
你是想提出新的辩辞吗
是的  法官大人
辩方律师是在试图引导陪审团

-Single possible detail?!  - She's trying to build
- A case on a staple...  - okay, okay, Mrs. Florrick!
None of this was in the first trial.
Is it your intention to pursue a new defense?
Yes, your honor.
Counsel's trying to mislead the jury.

687
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,170
她是在暗示一桩警界腐败案
闭嘴  马坦
她是否说对了  这才是问题所在
你有没有隐瞒什么
我们都知道这是怎么回事
彼得?福瑞克是个腐败的

She's implying there was police corruption.
Oh, shut up, Matan!
Is she right? That's the question.
Did you bury something?
We all know what's going on here.
Peter Florrick was a corrupt

693
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,040
并且已经被定罪的州检察官
即使有证据被隐瞒  也是他隐瞒的
现在她学到了她丈夫那手
你拿来的材料
也是少了几页的
我要你周一之前

And convicted state's attorney.
If evidence was buried, he buried it.
And now she's benefiting from his knowledge.
Which still leaves you
With some pages missing here!
I'll give you till Monday

699
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,540
把他们补齐
还要呈上他们提过的所有证据
那时我再进行裁决
至于你  福瑞克律师
这些东西我不清楚是别人给你的
还是你自己找到的

To produce them
Along with any evidence they reference.
Then I'll rule on admissibility.
And you, Mrs. florrick,
I'm not sure if you're being fed this stuff,
Or you doing on your own,

705
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,940
但如果是前者
那你就是在铤而走险  挑战道德底线
你明白吗
明白  法官大人
指令很简单
按照第一阶段审讯的套路就行了

But if it's the former,
You're walking a very narrow ethical line here.
You understand that?
Yes, your honor.
The directive was simple.
Follow the strategy of the first trial.

711
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,490
不过  你得拼命去搜集那些
即使对你的案子毫无帮助的证据
我和第一陪审团会谈过
他们以11:1的投票予以定罪
对不起  不是这样的  当时双方票数相等
不  有一半的陪审员改变了投票

Instead, you're pushing for evidence
That might not even help your case.
I interviewed the first jury,
And they voted 11 to one to convict.
Excuse me. That's not true. It was evenly split.
No. Half the jurors switched their votes

717
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,020
虽然没有全数通过就不能开庭
所以我运用了自己的判断力来改变策略
你的判断力就是不及时向我们反馈信息吗
她只是初级助理
却自视过高
他丈夫曾是州检察官

When they couldn't get a troubled juror to deliberate.
So, I used my judgement to change strategies.
And was it your judgement not to update us?
She's a junior associate
Who doesn't think she's a junior associate.
Her husband was a state's attorney.

723
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,990
她过去住在高地公园
这不只是在训练一只老狗
而是在训练一只骄傲的老狗
好了  戴安  关键是她在搜集那些
被你忽视的证据
我知道你教导过不少女律师

She lived in highland park.
It's not just teaching an old dog new tricks.
It's teaching an entitled dog new tricks.
Come on, Diane. The problem is she's catching evidence
That you overlooked.
I've seen you mentor these women

729
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,290
直到她们开始与你竞争
-然后你....  - 什么  你在说什么
我提议惩戒一下艾丽西娅
任命凯里为首席律师
谢谢
肯定是她  对吗

Until they start competing with you.
- And then you...  - What? Excuse me?
I say we reprimand Alicia
And put Cary in as first chair.
Thank you.
That's her, isn't it?

735
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,520
索尼娅  你能不能....
艾丽西娅?福瑞克的办公室
请稍等
詹尼弗  接电话
喂
你好  宝贝儿

Sonia, can you...?
Alicia florrick's office.
One moment, please.
Jennifer, pick up.
Hello?
Hi, baby.

741
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,250
我好想你
艾丽西娅
是狗毛
被掩埋了的证据
我和一个取证室的一个朋友谈过
他让我查阅了证据记录

I miss you so much.
Alicia.
It's dog hair.
The pitted evidence.
I talked to a friend at the crime lab.
Gave me a preview of the evidence.

747
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,390
记录
受害者的身上发现有狗毛
警察排除了这点
因为他们在迈克尔的住处也发现了狗毛
他们猜测属于同一只狗
结果不是吗

A preview?
It's dog hair found on the victim's clothes.
Cops pitted it
Because they found dog hair at Michael's residence
And thought it was the same.
But it's not?

753
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,450
那是只意大利灵提
迈克尔和詹尼弗都没养过这种狗
还有  狗毛上有一种药剂成分
爱克托林
一种用于肌肉和关节疼痛的犬用药剂
那是化学元素号码吗

It's from an Italian greyhound.
Neither Michael nor Jennifer had greyhounds.
So also, a chemica on the hair...
Alco ectolin...
A lotion for muscle and joint pain.
That's the chemical number?

759
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,350
不  是他的手机号
我答应陪他喝一杯
所以我们现在要找的是
一只患有关节病的意大利灵提的饲养者
我们  我听说你被降为列座律师了
什么时候

No, his cell number.
I agreed to drinks.
So we're looking
For an arthritic greyhound owner.
We? I hear you're being bumped to second chair.
When?

765
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,990
明天下班
凯里被提升了
他会采用第一阶段审讯的策略
他这一年坏运不断
现在  这位全明星后卫又要
控告他的前女友伤害罪

End of tomorrow.
Cary's being transitioned in.
And he'll go back to the first trial strategy.
It's not a good year for him.
The all-star point guard is currently suing
His ex-girlfriend for damages,

771
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,590
希望法官最终能裁定
这个案子是实情还是炒作
你可能只知道她叫  "安贝儿"
是个曾使州检察官--芝加哥坏小子
彼得?福瑞克堕落的年轻女人
尽管她表示想把这件丑闻抛到脑后

Hoping the judge can finally determine
Whether this case was fact or fantasy.
You know her simply as "Amber,"
The young woman who brought down
Bad boy Chicago state's attorney Peter Florrick.
Though she says she wants to leave the scandal far behind,

777
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,590
但这位应召女郎安贝儿?麦迪逊
其实已决定要写一本她和福瑞克的回忆录
在内部的独家报道中...
你真的还要工作啊
对  还需要十多分钟
扎克  我用下你的电脑

Celebrity call girl Amber Madison
Has decided to write a memoir about her time with florrick.
In this exclusive interview with Inside Edition...
Do you really have to work?
Yeah, ten more minutes.
Zack, I need your computer.

783
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,920
妈妈  我刚升级了我的警告级别
好的  宝贝儿  我替你高兴
当彼得的父亲在伊利诺斯州法院工作时
他从来不把案子带回家  一次也没有
他是法官  杰姬  我只是初级助理  扎克
帮我把这两个盘放在一起进行对比播放

Mom, I just raised my wanted level.
Yeah, I'm happy for you, honey.
When Peter's father was on the illinois court,
He never brought a single case home, not once.
He was a judge, Jackie. I'm a junior associate. Zach?!
I need you to play These two computer disks side by side.

789
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,820
能把我的电脑和你的放一块吗
你妹妹怎么样了
她还在和奶奶对抗吗
这是什么
这是凶案当晚的一个视频
就是一些死者的遗容

Can you set up my computer next to yours?
Hey, how's your sister?
She still fighting with grandma?
What is it?
It's video Of the night of the murder.
Like faces of death?

795
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,020
妈妈  我看过更可怕的
你真可爱
哪有
是的  你很可爱
扎克  定住画面
怎么了  那是什么

Mom, I've seen worse.
You're adorable.
I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Zach, freeze it!
What? What is it?

801
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,150
是证据
诺斯先生  这是谋杀当晚11点03分
那是你
在停车场每小时巡逻一次  对吗
是的
你没有看到小货车或劫车人跑过

It's proof.
This is at 11:03 the night of the murder, Mr. North,
And... that's you
Making your hourly circuit of the lot, correct?
Yes, that's correct.
And you saw no pickup truck, no carjacker racing past,

807
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,450
没看到任何被告宣称她看到的东西
是的
谢谢
没有问题了  法官大人
福瑞克律师
请将监控录像拿进来好吗

Nothing the defendant Claims she saw.
That's correct.
Thank you.
Nothing further, your honor.
Mrs. Florrick.
Can we have the monitors in, please?

813
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,680
谢谢
州检察官来了
诺斯先生
他们现在担心她会
从她丈夫那学到些技巧
这是三个图像

Thank you.
State's attorney's here.
Now, Mr. North...
They're worried she's getting
The stuff from her husband.
Here are three images.

819
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,630
中间是15号晚的监控录像
也就是案发当晚
左边是14号晚的录像
也就是案发的前一晚
右边是16号的  也就是案发后的第二晚
你能看到上面的日期吗

The middle is the image of the surveillance from the 15th,
The night of the murder,
And the one over there on the left is the image from the 14th,
The night before the murder, and the one
On the right is from the 16th, the night after the murder.
Can you see the dates on those?

825
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,050
是的  可以
按照你之前说的  那个人是你
当时是案发当晚的11点03分
你在停车场巡逻
这个则是你在案发前一晚
再看案发后第二晚  你也在做相同的事

Uh, yes, I can.
So, as you said before, there you are
The night of the murder, at 11:03,
Making your circuit of the lot.
And... there you are the night before the murder
And the night after, doing the same thing.

831
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,190
-这肯定很闷  -不会  女士
我的工作没有你的报酬多  但我爱它
很好
现在  诺斯先生
我们快进一下  可以吗
案发当晚  45分钟后

- It must get old. - Um, no, Madam.
My job doesn't pay as much as yours, but i still love it.
Okay, good.
Now, Mr. North,
Let's fast-forward, shall we?
45 minutes...the night of the murder.

837
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,720
那个
你看到什么了
-没什么  -没有吗
就在那里  也许你
需要靠近点
是个购物袋  看上去像个购物袋

And there.
What do you see?
- Nothing. - No?
It's right there...maybe you
Need to move in a little closer.
Oh, it's a shopping bag, it looks like a shopping bag.

843
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,250
事实上  那就是购物袋
是个塑料购物袋
当晚风很大  那塑料袋被吹过停车场
-在11点48分  -法官大人  反对
-这与本案有什么关系  -我也不知道
但我很感兴趣  你呢  布罗迪先生

Actually, it is.
It's a plastic shopping bag.
It was a very windy night that night, and it blew across the lot
- At 11:48. - Your honor, objection.
- What does it have to do with anything. - Beats me.
But I'm interested, aren't you, Mr. Brody?

849
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,680
反对无效
好的  那么我们将其他两个录像
案发前和案发后的录像
快进到同一个时间点
这是14号的
这是16号的

Overruled.
Okay, so let's fast-forward the other two monitors
The night before the murder and the night after the murder
To the same time code.
Here's the 14th...
And the 16th.

855
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,120
你看到什么了
我不知道
我认为你知道  先生
要么是你让一个塑料袋
每晚11点48分被吹过停车场
要么这些就是同一卷录像的复本

What do you see?
Um... I don't know.
I think you do know, sir.
Either you have a plastic bag
Blow across your lot every night at 11:48,
Or these are duplicates of the same tape.

861
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,750
不是的
不是你们看到的那样
我明白  先生
你并不是有意要误导警察
是的  没错
只是天越来越冷  所以有时候

No, it...
It's not wh-what it looks like.
I understand, Sir.
You didn't willfully mislead the police.
Yeah, that's correct.
No, it's just that it gets cold out there, and sometimes

867
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,920
-你没去停车场巡逻  -是的
所以当你不去巡逻时
你就不录下当晚的监控图像
你将电脑设置好
复制前一天晚上的图像
以防经理检查

- You don't make the circuit of the lot. - Yes.
So on the nights that you don't go out,
You don't record the actual surveillance image,
You set your computer up
To duplicate the night before,
Just in case your manager checks in,

873
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,720
是这样吗
是的
因此我确定
案发当晚没有录像
而且你也没在那看到或没看到
小货车或劫车者

Is that correct?
Yes.
Just so I'm clear,
There is no recording the night of the murder,
And you were never there to see or not see
The pickup truck or the carjacker.

879
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,990
对不起
是的
没有问题了
所以你在想
推翻控方主要证人
是否能保住你首席的位置

I'm sorry.
Uh, yes.
No further questions.
So, you're wondering whether demolishing
The key prosecution witness
Didn't just save your ass as first chair

885
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,370
干得好  顺便说一句
谢谢
但那的确足以进行合理的怀疑
知道是什么害了你吗
-轮胎里的钉子  -是的
还有那过时的本田

Nice work, by the way.
Thanks.
But was that enough for reasonable doubt.
You know what hurts you?
- Nail in the tire. - Yep.
And the old Honda.

891
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,770
这感觉不像是劫车案
像是谋杀伪造得像劫车案
如果我不进行辩护会怎样
什么  承认这就是个谋杀吗
那么陪审团就会要你指出一个嫌犯
太晚了

It just doesn't feel like a carjacking.
It feels like a murder Made to look like a carjacking.
What if I don't fight it?
What, agree that it was just a murder?
Then the jury needs a suspect.
It's late.

897
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,440
就像以前
举证程序
模拟审判
你记得这个啊
我怎么会忘呢
-那个案子我们输了吗  -是的

It's like old times.
Evidentiary procedure.
The mock trial.
You remember that?
How could I forget?
- Did we lose That one?  - Yeah!

903
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,970
福瑞克夫人  我只是想恭喜你
听说你在法庭上表现很好
谢谢  索尼娅
索尼娅
要走了吗
是啊  我和委托人约了一起吃早餐

Um, Mrs. Florrick, I just want to say congratulations.
I heard you did well in court.
Thanks, Sonia.
Sonia.
Heading out?
Yeah. I got a breakfast meeting with clients.

909
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,700
怎么了
有点儿不对劲
-迈克尔跟前妻吃饭  -对
他对詹尼弗说非常想她
-怀念他们共度的时光  -是啊
-辛迪会怎么想  -第二个老婆吗

What?
Something just doesn't seem right.
- Michael has dinner with his first wife.  - Right.
He tells Jennifer he missed her,
- Missed her all life together.  - Right.
- What does Cindy think about it?  - The second wife?

915
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,340
辛迪会想不开
陪审团会同情她
那就想办法让他们不同情
辛迪的哥哥呢  你查出什么情况
这些是他的就业记录
很好  尸检报告呢

Cindy thinks some unhappy thoughts.
Jury liked her.
Get them not to.
What did you get on Cindy's brother?
These are his employment records.
Good. What about the lab report?

921
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,910
这儿  不过他们会一直提出反对的
你得自己顺藤摸瓜
-作出整理  -福瑞克律师
有空吗
我们从前应该没见过
我是格伦?查尔兹

Here. But they're gonna object the whole way.
You'll need to just string together
- Some implications.  - Mrs. Florrick
You have a moment?
I don't think we've ever met before.
I'm Glenn Childs.

927
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,780
我们见过了
你知道他在利用你  对吧
彼得以为是我把他搞下台的
所以利用你来对付我
你怎么想到的
福瑞克女士

We've met.
You know he's using you, don't you?
Peter blames me for his downfall.
He's using you to get to me.
How do you figure?
Mrs. Florrick, please.

933
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,710
是他让你追查被掩埋的证据的
别给自己惹祸上身
这是为你自己好
查尔兹先生
那天你把性丑闻录像带交给了媒体
让我不得不挡着孩子们

He told you about the pitted trace evidence.
Don't make yourself collateral damage here,
For your own sake.
Mr. Childs,
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press
And forced me to shield my children

939
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,840
不让他们看到所有电视台节目里
每天24小时的滚动播出
从那时起  我已经有祸在身了
如果你担心的是我丈夫  查尔兹先生
那您以前明显没有真正激怒过女人
出庭好运

From every cable news station that played it
In a 24-hour rotation,
That was the day I became collateral damage.
If you're worried about my husband, Mr. Childs,
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.
Well, good luck in court.

945
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,210
刘易斯女士  你和死者
签过婚前协议吗
是的  税务原因
所以我们假设死者要和你离婚
是为了和前妻重修旧好
反对

Mrs. Lewis, did you and the deceased
Sign a prenuptial agreement?
Uh, yes, for tax purposes.
So if the deceased were to divorce you, let's say,
In order to reunite with his first wife..
Objection.

951
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
反对有效
如果死者要和你离婚
你将无权获得死者的婚前财产
-是这样吗  -反对
-与本案无关  -反对有效
请更换问题  福瑞克女士

Sustained.
If the deceased were to divorce you,
You would be cut off from his premarital savings,
- Is that correct?  - Objection.
- Relevance.  - Sustained.
Move it along, Mrs. Florrick.

957
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,710
刘易斯女士  您在证词中说
案发当时
您在迈阿密
所以警方从未怀疑或询问过您
怀疑我是凶手吗  对  当然没有
那您哥哥呢

Mrs. Lewis, you stated in your testimony
That you were in Miami
At the time of the shooting visiting family,
So the police never suspected or questioned you of the murder?
Of the murder? No, of course not.
What about your brother?

963
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,580
反对  法官大人  拜托
辩方律师的整个讯问过程就是个烟雾弹
布罗迪先生  我们还是先等等
等真的有烟雾出来  再说这是烟雾弹吧
反对无效
警方从未询问过您哥哥

Objection! Your honor, come on,
This whole line of questioning is a smokescreen.
Mr. Brody, why don't we wait
For a whiff of smoke before we call it a screen, please.
I'll allow.
The police never questioned your brother,

969
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,740
是吗  刘易斯女士
他们没理由这么做
因为他住在迈阿密吗
因为丹尼与本案无关
刘易斯女士  庭上已经接受了
留着吧

Isn't that correct, Mrs. Lewis?
Well, they had no reason to.
Because he lived in Miami?
Because Danny had nothing to do with this.
Mrs. Lewis, the judge has admitted into evidence the buried...
Strike that.

975
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,440
之前公布的证据作为本案的证据
同时也接受了
尸检出的一些意大利灵提的毛发
上面有一种叫爱克托林的药物的残留物
您听说过吗
不好意思  是一种药吗  没听过

...the previously unreleased trace evidence.
He has also admitted into evidence
The crime lab's finding that these greyhound hairs were covered
In a chemical compound called Alco Ectolin.
Have you heard of this?
Sorry, the chemical? No.

981
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,410
我也没听过
是一种外涂药剂
是涂在赛狗身上用来缓解...
-反对  跟证据不符  -反对有效
布罗迪先生  你最好还是起立吧
我有预感我们快看到你说的烟雾弹了

No, neither had I.
It is a lotion.
It is a lotion that is used at dog racing tracks to ease...
- Objection. Not in evidence. - Sustained.
And you might want to stay standing, Mr. Brody.
I have a feeling we're nearing your smokescreen.

987
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,810
刘易斯女士
凶案发生一年前
您哥哥在赛狗场工作过
这是事实吗
反对
反对有效

Mrs. Lewis,
Isn't it a fact
That a year ago at the time of the murder,
Your brother worked at a dog track?
Objection!
Sustained.

993
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,040
没有问题了
你还没喝呀
拜托  喝之前还有一堆祝酒词呢
为了首战告捷  敬你一杯
喝吧
好吧

No further questions.
You're not just making this up?
Come on it's still a lots of call tradition
Your first jury trial-- shot of tequila.
Let's go.
Okay.

999
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,440
我也干了
声音真好听  不是吗
你猜陪审团会坚持多久
我很久以前就不猜这个了
他们让你老公等了多长时间
6小时

Yeah, I just made that up.
Sounded good, though,  didn't it?
How long do you think they'll stay out?
Oh, I stopped guessing about juries a while ago.
How long were they out with your husband?
Six hours.

1005
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,710
我有点不明白
你为什么还支持他
换了是我  我会一刀捅进他心脏
我一直觉得我也该这样
以前我听到人们的丑闻  想到那些老婆们时
我还在想...

You know what I don't get?
Why you stood by him.
I would've stuck a knife in his heart
I always thought I would, too.
But when I heard about those other scandals, the other wives...
I thought...

1011
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,980
你们怎么能让自己这样被人利用
然后事情就发生在我自己身上了
我只是...
...没有准备好
你好
好的

How can you allow yourself to be used like that?
And then it happened,
And I was...
...unprepared.
Hello?
Yes.

1017
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,140
谢谢
陪审团到了吗
福瑞克律师
芝加哥杀人案已经决定
重亲打开迈克尔?刘易斯遇害一案的
调查记录

Thanks.
Jury's in?
Well, Mrs. Florrick,
Chicago homicide has decided
To reopen its investigation into
The murder of Michael Lewis

1023
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,380
布里格斯警官
做了一项令人钦佩的尽职调查
已经确认辛迪?刘易斯的哥哥丹尼
在案发的同一周
钻进了他老板的小货车
而那些已被采纳为证物的狗毛

Detective Briggs,
Doing an admirable amount of due diligence,
Has confirmed that Cindy Lewis's brother Danny
Had access to his employer's pickup truck
The week of the murder.
And the dog hairs Admitted into evidence

1029
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,380
与在他工作地点找到的相吻合
所以我们的州检察官
凭借着他光芒四射的智慧
已经决定撤销对你客户的控告了
并且立案侦查刘易斯先生弟弟的案件了
这样没错吧  布罗迪先生

Match those found at his workplace.
So our State's attorney,
In his radiant wisdom,
Has decided to withdraw the charges against your client
And pursue a case against Mrs. Lewis's brother.
Isn't that right, Mr. Brody?

1035
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,980
我只要听"是"或者"不是"
是
很好
那我们可以结案了
谢谢你  非常感谢
杰姬

All I need is a yes or no.
Yes.
Good.
Then we're done here.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Hi, Jackie.

1041
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,940
没事  只是晚了一点  没事的
我做了烤肉  我在想
你回不回来吃晚饭
怎么了  我说啥了
没事  只是我过去也常常对彼得这么说
你还在吗

No, it just went a little late, that's all.
I made a pot roast, and I was wondering
If you were coming home for dinner.
What? What did I say?
Nothing. It's just that's what I always used to say to Peter.
Are you there?

1047
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,040
在  我只是还得去拿点东西
很快就回来了
杰姬  我不知道我以前是否说过
但是  谢谢你  肯做出改进
我当然会这么做  为啥不会
待会儿见

Yeah, yeah. I just need to pick up a few things,
And I'll be home soon.
Jackie, I don't know if I've said this,
But thank you... for stepping up.
Of course I would. Why wouldn't I?
I'll see you soon.

1053
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,310
好的
再见
抱歉
我不知道你在
这是点小小的心意
你做得很棒

All right, then.
Good-bye.
Oh. Hey. Sorry.
I didn't know you were here.
Just a little office token.
You did great.

1059
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,610
谢谢夸奖
我做得确实不错  是吧
还有件事
什么事
你已经是我的民事诉讼案件的
列座律师了

Thanks.
I did, didn't I?
Oh, one more thing.
Yes, sir?
You've been made my second chair
In the civil case.

1065
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,610
明早九点半  员工会议上见
我会准时出席的
是我
很抱歉  你肯定已经睡了
我只是想说
高等法院同意重审我的案子了

See you tomorrow at 9:30, staff meeting.
I'll be there.
Hey, it's me.
I'm sorry, you must be in bed,
But I just want
The appellate court agreed to hear my case.

1071
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,510
我到现在都不敢相信
律师认为我们翻案有很大胜算
他们明天会做一个正式的声明
但是  我只是想先告诉你
我会很快见到你的

I still can't believe it.
The lawyers think we have a really good shot at overturning this,
And they're gonna make an official statement tomorrow.
But, uh, I just wanted to tell you first.
I'll see you soon.
